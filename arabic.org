?? What is the goal of this article?

To quickly introduce the Arabic language, through its “root system” ---i.e., most words have 3-letters at their core---
and how these roots can be placed in “patterns” to obtain new words. Namely, a glance at Arabic's Verb Forms: These give
you 10 words for each root!  Some *red:advanced* concepts will also be mentioned, for those curious, but should be ignored
on a first reading.  These are notes of things that I'm learning; there's likely errors.

#+begin_documentation arabic-root

The Arabic language is based on “roots” that link words of related meanings.

An Arabic “root” is the sequence of (usually 3) Arabic letters that carry the underlying meaning of a word, for example
ش−ر−ب “to drink” and ح−م−ل “to carry”.

Vowels and consonants are added around the roots to create related words.
/Roots are the building blocks of the Arabic language and are helpful for guessing the meaning of vocabulary./

Generally foreign loan words, such as /internet/ انترنت, fall outside the root system.
#+end_documentation

#+begin_documentation arabic-vowels
Arabs /infer/ vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ
“he was carried”.

As an example sentence with vowels written, Prophet Muhammad is known to have said:
| أنَا مَدِينَةُ الْعِلْمِ وَعَلَيٌ بَابُهَا                                |
| /I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate/ |

Incidentally, Ali was the one who commissioned the system of vowels.
https://blogs.transparent.com/arabic/the-beginning-of-dotting-and-diacritics-in-arabic/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arabic has only three short vowels, or حركات (literally: “movements”), which are written as small symbols above/below
letters.

| Vowel name  | Vowel sound | Arabic | English example |
| Fatha;  فتحة  | /a/           | ـَ       | /mat/             |
| Dhamma; ظمّة  | /u/           | ـُ       | /sugar/           |
| Kasra; كسرة  | /i/           | ـِ       | /bit/             |

The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using
sukkun, هْهْهْهْ. It is important for consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, such as بَابْ “bab” which means /door./

Incidentally, when a sound needs to be repeated twice, it is usually written once with a /Shadda/ ـّـ to indicate the
doubling.  For example, فَهِمَ /fahima/ “he understood” but فَهَّمَ /fahhama/ “he explained”. Shadda is used with الـ + ‘sun
letters’. Unlike the other short vowels, the Shadda is usually written even in informal Arabic, to avoid ambiguity.


Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters /after/ the short vowels:
 | Long vowel  sound | Arabic | English example |
 | /aa/                | ـَا      | /far/             |
 | /ii/                | ـِي      | /meet/            |
 | /uu/                | ـُو      | /boot/            |

Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels /aa,ii,uu/ (when
preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds /a,y,w/.
 + For example, as a consonant, [[https://arabic.fi/letters/74][ي]] makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.
 + Occasionally, /aa/ is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots) rather than an
   /alif/. This always happens at the end of a word and is called /alif maqsuura/
   “broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسی “Musa”.

The following video reads all Arabic letters, where each letter is vowelised by one of the 3 short vowels. It's a really
nice video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1Cl6W8EEBQ?start=6.
#+end_documentation

#+begin_documentation arabic-passive
A “passive” verb is one where the subject undergoes the action of the verb rather than carries out the action, for
example حُملت “she was carried” and يُستخدم “it is used”.
#+end_documentation

#+begin_documentation arabic-transitive
A “transitive” verb is a verb that requires an object to express a complete thought, otherwise it is “intransitive”.
Some verbs are both transitive and intransitive.

A “transitive” verb needs to /transfer its action/ to something or someone ---the object.
In essence, transitive means “to affect something else.”

For example, “Please bring coffee.” would not be a complete thought without the object “coffee”.
That is, “Please bring.” is an incomplete thought: What or whom should we bring? As such, “bring” is a transitive verb.
In contrast, “Please sing.” is a complete thought, and so “sing” is an intransitive verb ---actually, it's also transitive.

In Arabic, the Form-4 أفْعَلَ pattern turns intransitive verbs into transitive ones; and turns transitive verbs into
doubly-transitive verbs ---which means it takes two objects: E.g., “I gave the boy the ball”, here “gave” is
doubly-transitive. E.g., in Form-4, ر−س−ل “to send” gives the transitive verb أرْسَلَ which means it can be followed by two
objects: أرْسَلَ الولد لكتاب “The boy sent the book”.

* The Arabic Root System
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: The-Arabic-Root-System
:END:

Most Arabic words are derived from a three-letter [[doc:arabic-root][root]] ---notable exceptions are words like “and” وَ
and “on” علی.  A root, or مصدر “masdar”, refers to the core meaning of a word.  Simply put, roots are identified by
ignoring all non-vowel letters, resulting in usually 3 letters ---and, rarely, 4 letters.  /Roots are the building
blocks of the Arabic language and are helpful for guessing the meaning of vocabulary./

For example, the sequence of letters س−ف−ر (read right-to-left as s-f-r) carries the meaning of “travel”.
Any word containing these letters, in this order, likely has something to do with travel. For example:

   | English    | Arabic | Transliteration |
   |------------+--------+------------ |
   | journey    | سفر     | safar           |
   | he travels | يسافر    | yusafir         |
   | amabassdor | سفير    | safeer          |
   | traveller  | مسافر    | musafir         |
   | embassy    | سفارة    | sifara          |

All of these words are derived from the root س−ف−ر, s-f-r, in this order.
/Much of Arabic grammar is concerned with how the root is manipulated to create different related meanings:
Additional letters, or vowels, modify the meaning according to different general patterns./
card:Yes

Likewise, ك−ت−ب is a root regarding “writing”, from which we can obtain numerous words:
#+html: <center><a href="http://oerabic.llc.ed.ac.uk/"><img src="http://roots.oerabic.llc.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/02/1a1.png" height=500></a></center>

# *The emphasis on root consonants means that vowels, especially short vowels, are of secondary importance.*

#+begin_details "Can't we simply just stick the roots together?"
*No.*

For example the letters ح−م−ل have the meaning of “to carry” but naively connecting the letters gives us حمل, which,
without any context, could be read as
- حَمَلَ “he carried”, or
- حُمِلْ “he was carried”!
  - ([[doc:arabic-vowels][Vowel signs ـْ ـَ ـِ ـُ]] are discussed below.)

Both of these words are specific to
1. a male person,
2. in the past, and
3. it's not clear whether the person is doing the carrying or the one being carried.

Thus حمل is far more specific than the general meaning of ح−م−ل “to carry” ---which is not itself a word, but an abstract
sequence of letters.

#+end_details

#+begin_details Irregular Roots
Irregular roots do not consist of 3 different consonants; instead, they fall into three categories:

+ Doubled roots :: where the second and third root letters are the
  same.

  − If a doubled verb is put into a form involving a sukkun ـْـ
    on the 3rd root, then the 2nd and 3rd letters are written
    separately; otherwise, the 2nd and 3rd letters are written together
    with a shadda ـّـ.

  − For example, ر−د−د “to reply” becomes رَدَّ “he replied” when placed in the
    masculine-second-person-past-tense form فَعَلَ, but becomes رَدَدْتُ “I replied” when placed in the
    first-person-past-tense form فَعَلْتُ. [[red:More on forms below!]]

  - In doubt: Doubled roots are usually written together.

+ Weak roots :: where one of the three root letters is و or ي; for example ق−و−ل “to speak”.
  - These letters are “so weak” that they change from the constant sounds و/w and ي/y to vowel
    sounds or disappear entirely, depending on the pattern the root is placed in.
  − If و‌/ي is the first root, then it almost always drops out in the present tense.
    For example, و−ص−ل “to arrive” becomes أَصِلُ “I arrive” in the first-person-present-tense
    أَفْعُلُ form. Contrast this with the regular root ك−ت−ب “to write” becoming أَكْتُبُ “I write”.

  # - If و/ي is the second root, it becomes a /short vowel/ if the form places a sukuun on the 3rd root, and otherwise it becomes a /long vowel/.

+ Hamzated roots :: where one of the root letters is hamza ء; for example ق−ر−ء “to read”.

# What are Arabic's vowels?


/What are the vowels that can be added to roots to make new words?/

Arabic has 28 letters, and like cursive English, it is written with letters connected.

Each letter has 4 forms: The isolated form, the form where the letter starts a word, the form where the letter is in the
middle of a word, and the form where a letter is at the end of a word. So, Arabic has 28 * 4 = 112 distinct shapes for
its alphabet.  (Since some letters do not connect forwards, the isolated form actually does appear in written text.  For
example, او means “or” and it consists of two isolated letters.)  For example, the letter /ha/ has the following forms:
| isolated | initial | medial | final |
|----------+---------+--------+-------|
| ه        | هـ       | ـهـ     | ـه     |

If a friend texts you something funny, you reply with ههههه −−− “hahaha”.

[[card:I have a question]]
But, where are the short vowels “a”? *Arabic short vowels are generally not written!*

There are only three short vowels in Arabic: /a/, /i/ and /u/.
They are denoted by small symbols above/below letters, for example:
     | Vowel | Example | English reading |
     |-------+---------+-----------------|
     | ـَـ     | هَهَهَهَ    | hahahaha        |
     | ـُـ     | هُهُهُهُ    | huhuhuhu        |
     | ـِـ     | هِهِهِهِ    | hihihihi        |

Incidentally, the sound “h” is obtained by using the “no vowel” marker: هْـ.  So with the 3 short vowels and the fourth
symbol to indicate the absence of a vowel, there are a total of 4 * 28 = 112 sounds in Arabic.

#+begin_details Tell me more about Arabic Vowels!
Arabs /infer/ vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ
“he was carried”.

As an example sentence with vowels written, Prophet Muhammad is known to have said:
| أنَا مَدِينَةُ الْعِلْمِ وَعَلَيٌ بَابُهَا                                |

Arabic has only three short vowels, or حركات (literally: “movements”), which are written as small symbols above/below

| Kasra / كسرة | /i/           | ـِ       | /bit/             |

The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using
sukkun, هْهْهْهْ.

Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters /after/ the short vowels:

 | /aa/                | ـَا      | /far/             |

 | /uu/                | ـُو      | /boot/            |

Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels /aa,ii,uu/ (when
preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds /a,y,w/.
 + For example, as a consonant, [[https://arabic.fi/letters/74][ي]] makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.
 + Occasionally, /aa/ is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots) rather than an
   /alif/. This always happens at the end of a word and is called /alif maqsuura/
   “broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسی “Musa”.

card:Disagree
/Of-course, there is more to the story!/ There is the “glottal stop”, Hamza ـٔ , and other special characters and symbols
above/below letters.  So the counts of 112 are not exact.  For example, some letters, like alif ا, have the same shape
for different forms, but sometimes it can be written as ی such as علی “on” and موسی “Musa”.

#+begin_details "The Arabic Hamza ـٔ is like the English Apostrophe ـ'"
# /Hamza/ ء is a “half” letter; it can be written in a variety of ways: By itself on the line ء or carried by an /alif/
# أ or by /ya/ یٔ/ـٔـ or by /waw/ ؤ.

     1. In both cases there is uncertaininty as to when and how to use it, even among native speakers.
     2. Whereas in English we ask ourselves: /Should the apostrophe come before the “s” or after the “s”?/, in Arabic the
        question becomes: /Which letter should carry the hamza?/.
     3. The hamza itself is considered a consonant, not a vowel, pronounced as a short pause.
     4. Like the apostrophe, the rules for hamza are more concerned with where to place it than how to pronounce it.
     5. General rules:
        - At the start of a word, hamza is written on an alif: أ
        - This might result in two alifs side-by-side, if so then merge them
          into /alif madda/ آ, which is read as a long /aa/ sound.
        - Otherwise, the letter carrying the hamza tends to relate to the vowel /before/ the hamza:
          If we have ـُـ ، ـِـ ، ـَـ before the hamza, then the hamza is written ؤ ، یٔ/ـٔـ ، أ respectively.
          - If we have ـْـ before the hamza, we write ؤ ، یٔ/ـٔـ ، أ
            depending on the vowel the hamza root should be taking.
            For example, س−ء−ل “to ask” becomes يسْأَل “he asks” in the
            masculine-second-person-present-tense (يَفْعَلُ form, for this
            particular root).

* ف−ع−ل : The template for any 3 core root letters
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ف-ع-ل-The-template-for-any-3-core-root-letters
:END:

As a symbol to represent the three root letters of any word, Arabic grammars uses the roots of the prototypical verb فعل
“to do”, read /fa'al/.

For example, the root ك−ت−ب is associated with “writing”.  The word for “office” مَكْتَب is the مَفْعَل-pattern: The root
letters have مَـ before them, a sukkun ـْـ over the first root letter, and a fatha ـَـ over the second root letter. In the
same way, “books” كُتُب is the فُعُل-pattern.


[[card:Let's take a break]]
Below are some example patterns.  /If you are faced with an Arabic word that you never heard before, you can guess
the meaning by its root and pattern./

This is known as the dimunative. For example, in English we say /ducky/ to refer to a small duck ---whereas /duckling/ also
means a small duck, but it is more formal.

* Verb Forms: The True Power of Arabic's Form System
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: Verb-Forms-Page-38-chapter-7
:END:

# If you see a word, you can guess at its meaning by recognising which form it is in and what its root is.

The richness of Arabic is based on its system of word roots, and nowhere is this more evident than in the verb system. card:Agree

In English we can add extra letters to form different but connected meanings ---for example: /value, revalue, validate/.
Arabic takes this principle much farther with many different patterns that add meaning to the origninal root form.
These /derived/ forms are the major way in which Arabic achieves its richness of vocabulary. For example, from ق−ت−ل “to
kill”, we can obtain
| he killed                         | قتل  | qatala     |
| he massacred (“killed intensely”) | قتّل  | qattala    |
| he battled (“tried to kill”)      | قاتل  | qaatala    |
| they fought each other            | تقاتلوا | taqaataluu |

Here are the significant verb forms. For simplicitly, I'm presenting them in the /past tense/ using the root ف−ع−ل “to
do”.

2. There are an additional 5 forms, but they are super rare in usage.

3. In addition, Arabic speakers will sometimes make up new verbs from existing roots, either as a joke or in an
   effort to be creative or /✨poetic💐/.

Hello, my name is موسی الحسائی, and I am from Iraq!

/Note!/ On Lam-Alif, لا, I cannot get the fatha tanween, ـــً, to render *within* Emacs.
However, if you export to HTML, C-c C-e h o, then لاً will render with a taneween!
- This is an issue with my specific Emacs build; e.g., using Aquamacs
  (which has seemless MacOS look & feel) does not result in this issue
  at all.
  + Actually, they only show when the cursor is at the tanween and otehrwise also do not render.
  - "Noto Nastaliq Urdu" --this makes lam-alif tanween appear in my emacs! This is clearly not Arabic.
  - NotoKufiArabic is super ugly, but will also render it.

"Noto Sans Arabic" Also good! -- brew install  font-noto-sans-arabic  --cask

             "Sana" is super fun!

:END:

English relies on /word order/ for meaning; for example, /Jim hit Bob/ is a sentence where the person doing the action is
/Jim/ and we know it has to be /Jim/, and not /Bob/, since /Jim/ is the word /before/ the action /hit/. However, in Arabic words can
be ordered in almost any way you like! Then how do we identifiy who does an action? We use case markings: We add small
symbols to the end of words to indiciate the role they play in a sentence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


One day, my wife and I were looking at the word خبز, and we each read
it differently: I read it as خَبَزَ “he baked”, but she read it as خُبْز
“bread”. Without a context, we each guessed different short vowels!

Here's another one!

What does حملت mean? Since ح−م−ل means “carrying”, and ـت is the past tense suffix, we have /at least/ the following meanings:
| حَمَلْتُ | I carried               |
| حَمَلْتَ | You (masculine) carried |
| حَمَلْتِ | You (feminine) carried  |
| حَمَلَتْ | She carried             |
| حُمَِلتْ | She was carried         |

Without the short symbols, the only way to distinuigh the intended
meaning is for the word to be contextually located within a sentence
---and even then, this would require experience.

Likewise, what does نصرت فاطمة mean? Does it mean “Fatimah helped (someone)”? Or does it mean “Fatimah was helped (by
someone)”?


One English sentence can be written a number of ways in Arabic:

| Fatima helped Zaynab |
|----------------------|
| نصرت فاطمةُ  زينبَ         |
| نصرت زينبَ فاطمةُ          |
| فاطمةُ نصرت زینبَ          |
The way the listener knows what’s the subject and what’s the object is quite literally carried around with the nouns themselves. The endings make all the difference.

The second instance above might seem weird at first, since the object comes before the subject, but it is more common
when the object is an attached pronoun:
| نصرتْها فطمةُ | Fatima helped her. |
This is a common example of verb-object-subject!



1. Just as people dress according to roles or occassions (such as a
   suit at work and pajamas in bed), so too Arabic words have
   different case endings, التشكيلُ, to show their roles within a
   sentence.

   Roles are indicated by the vowel sign on the final letter of a word.

   | Subject; the one doing an action | ـُــ            | مارفوع / Nominative      |
   | Object; the one being acted upon | ـَــ            | منصوب / Accusative     |
   | Owner of a thing                 | ـِــ            | مجرور / Genetive         |


2. *Nunation*: When the word is indefinite, one “doubles” the symbols,
   which causes an extra /-n/ sound to each vowel: u ـُـ, a ـَـ, i ـِـ
   are replaced by un ـٌـ, an ـًـ, in ـٍـ.

* DONE COMMENT How to blog to hashnode?

:END:

+ Get markup :: C-c c-e C-b h h
+ Copy then Paste :: that into hashnode
+ Profit :: ^_^

Hashnode does not respect my CSS, unless I advertise/recruit for them (via their 'ambassador' program. Super lame!)

Likewise my inline JS ---a small root-meaning program--- is not honored by hasnode.

TODO. Consider moving back to my own personal blog setup?!
- But need a way to streamline *quick* article publishing!
  - My blog does provide a local-WYSIWYG: Just C-c C-e h o, or use one of those org-preview packages! <3
    - I like working on my blog, so that's fun for me.
      - However, my *current* goal is to learn arabic!
        - So maybe learn arabic, then migrate back to my personal blogging platform!
