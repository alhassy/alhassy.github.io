What are the basic forms of Karate? What is Karate?
</p>

<p>
<i>“The ultimate aim of karate lies not in victory or defeat but in the perfection
of the character of its participants … to subdue the enemy without fighting is</i>
<i>the highest skill, know your enemy and know yourself, in a hundred battles you
will not be defeated”</i> says Gichin Funakoshi &#x2014;known as The Father of Modern Karate.
</p>

<p>
<i>Karate</i> means “empty hand” and was developed on the island of Okinawa &#x2014;part of
modern-day Japan.  The major styles (“Ryu”) are Shotokan, Wado-ryu,
Shito-ryu, and Goju-ryu &#x2014;many other styles of Karate are derived from these
four. I'm focusing on Goju-Ryu in this article: Goju-Ryu was founded by Chojun
Miyagi; whose colleague, Gichin Funakosi, founded Shotokan-Ryu.
</p>

<div class="org-center">
<p>
<a href="http://www.traditionalshotokankarate.co.uk/kara-te-do.gif" class="tooltip" title="Image credit “http://www.traditionalshotokankarate.co.uk/kara-te-do.gif”"><img src="http://www.traditionalshotokankarate.co.uk/kara-te-do.gif" alt="Article image"
             width="nil" height="nil" align="top"/></a>
</p>
</div>

<p>
Occasionally one sees <i>Karate-Do</i>, which means “the way of the empty hand”.
This usage is a reminder that Karate is not just about fighting, but is also
a spiritual discipline.
</p>

<p>
The basic form of Goju-Ryu karate is Sanchin, “3 battles”: The battles of the
mind, the body, and the spirit.  However, this was considered a bit difficult
for beginners, and so new forms were needed as a way of introducing fundamental
karate forms to a wider audience.  There are the “peaceful and safe” forms known
as Pinan/Heian, the “first course” or Taikyoku forms, the “popularising forms”
known as Fukyugata &#x2014;the second of which was rebranded as “attack &amp; smash”,
Gekaisai&#x2014; and, finally, there is the so-called Dachi-waza form. This last one
is relatively new, and aims to be a smooth introduction to the world of
forms/Kata.
</p>

<p>
In this article, I'd like to discuss the basic forms and their relationships.

<h2 id="org3bf4a1a"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> <a href="#org3bf4a1a">Kata: Learning by Patterns</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
<i>Kata</i> means “forms”, which are patterns used to learn sequences of techniques.
Besides teaching kicking, strikes, etc; the repetition of patterns/Kata improves
physical conditioning and muscle memory.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interestingly, the phrase “kata” is used in Software Engineering for the same
goals: To refer to “families of similar (coding) problems” which may be solved
using an existing set of “design patterns”.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In general, repeating a fixed pattern over and over &#x2014;i.e., “doing kata”&#x2014;
reinforces the knowledge of fundamental techniques and stances via repetition.
However, there are numerous other benefits:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Solo Practice</dt><dd>Training without a partner is important, since you can then
train whenever and wherever you want. E.g., at your lunch break at work.</dd>

<dt>Mucle Memory</dt><dd>Repeatedly practicing kicks, strikes, blocks, etc,
means it will become easier to perform them, and doing them in fixed sequences
means your body will internalise different combinations. E.g., middle-block,
followed by forward-punch, and concluding with a snap-kick.</dd>

<dt>Improved Fitness</dt><dd><p>
Doing a kata, while focusing on your breathing &amp; stances,
is itself a quick workout. Adding weights, or doing the kata on your toes
only, or doing them slowly, or with extra power, not only provide a challenge
but also make the kata into a sort-of <i>moving meditation</i>:
Gichin Funakoshi says,
<i>In traditional karate-do, we always keep in mind that the true opponent is oneself.</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Of-course “real opponents move fast”, so one can also try practising the
kata at increased speeds, but ensuring the techniques are performed
correctly.</li>
<li>“Imaginary opponents don't hit back”, so the addition of weights, or the use
of extra power, can be used to compensate.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>When you train, do so as if on the battlefield. Your eyes should glare,</i>
<i>shoulders drop, and body harden. You should always train with intensity and
spirit and in this way you will naturally be ready.</i> &#x2014;Anko Itosu
</p></dd>

<dt>Safety</dt><dd><p>
Dangerous techniques can be practised without anyone getting hurt.
E.g., leg breaks, or the use of weapons, can be practised against an imaginary
opponent before actually practising with a real person.
</p>

<p>
<i>Do not think that you have to win, think rather that you do not have to lose.</i> &#x2014;Gichin Funakoshi
</p></dd>

<dt>Application / Bunkai</dt><dd>When fixed patterns are already learned, one can adapt
them to various real-life situations involving another person. I personally
liked it when the teacher would explain immediate applications of a pattern
<b>while</b> I was learning the pattern: It made it easy for me to imagine an
opponent attacking me as I practised the kata. Unfortunately, some teachers
insist on learning the patterns first, then learning the applications.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I think having some immediate application removes boredom, for beginners
especially; otherwise, the kata may feel too rigid and vague.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt>Accessibility</dt><dd><p>
Anyone can join in! E.g., I've done kata with my kids: It's a
fun little dance we do together; the goal is to have fun as a family.
</p>

<p>
<i>The ultimate aim of Karate lies not in victory or defeat, but in the
perfection of the character of its participants.</i> &#x2014;Gichin Funakoshi
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>
<span class="underline">The <i>benefits</i> of kata depends on your end-goal:</span> Are you looking for a workout?
Practising fundamental kicks &amp; stances? Fighting imaginary opponents? Or is it
just a way to relax from a hectic day. It's important to keep in mind that
Karate is not just about fighting!

Following the death of Chojun Miyagi Sensei in 1953, four main schools teaching Goju Ryu emerged.

The graphic of this article, the closed fist, is the symbol of Goju Kai which
was popularised in Ontario, Canada, by <a href="https://www.warrenerentertainment.com/fighting-spirit-blog/don-warrener/">Don Warrener</a>.  Initially, Miyagi tasked
<a href="https://blackbeltmag.com/black-belt-flashback-gogen-the-cat-yamaguchi-head-of-goju-karate">Gogen “The Cat” Yamaguchi</a> with spreading Goju Ryu in mainland Japan, outside of
Okinawa: Yamaguchi designed the closed fist symbol, based on the right hand of
Miyagi; he unified all karate schools in Japan; he propagated Goju all over the
world. Moreover, in this Goju Kai style, Yamaguchi added to the Goju system the
“Taikyoku Katas”, <i>First-course formations</i>, which consists of 5 formations all
making an “I”-shape in movement: The student starts at the bottom-middle of the
“I”, moves left, then right, then up, and eventually back down to the starting
position. Each formation reinforces basic principles, such as a certain block
and stance. These are intended as training methods for the beginner students to
prepare them for the more advanced kata.

Other schools skip these “school-children” fundamentals and start-off with
Gekisai Ich, <i>Attack and Destroy</i>, which is known as Goju Karate's first Kata.
However, the Jundokan school works up to this Kata a different way&#x2026;

<p>
The Fukyu Kata were made to popularise Karate and make it accessible.
Miyagi renamed Fukyu Kata to <i>Gekisai Dai Ichi</i>, “Attach and Destroy 1”
&#x2014;of-course the second kata of Goju Karate is known as “Attack and Destroy 2”
or <i>Gekisai Dai Ni</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Geki</i> ≈ <i>to attack</i></li>
<li><i>Sai</i> ≈ <i>to smash, break, crush</i></li>
<li><i>Gekisai</i> ≈ <i>to pulverise, to attack and destroy</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
The aggressive renaming of the ‘popularising’ kata, in the 1940s, may have been due
to Japan's war-time efforts.

<a href="http://www.ogkk.eu/historymaster/masters/eiichi_miyazato.htm">Eiichi Miyazato</a> was a Judo champion and a student of Miyagi; he wanted to pass
on Miyagi's legacy and so opened his own training-hall: The Jundokan &#x2014;which
literally means <i>House of Father's Way</i> or <i>House for Following in the Father's
Footsteps</i>. Among his famous students is Teruo Chinen, who introduced
“Tachi-Waza Kata” into the Jundokan Goju Kata syllabus.

<p>
<i>Note:</i> Tachi and Dachi are the same word, in Japanese, meaning <i>stance</i>. The sound
changes depending on if the letter is the start of a word.

<li>The feet are one shoulder width apart</li>
<li>The front foot points forward and the back foot points diagonally at about 30 degree angle</li>
<li>The front knee is bent, turned slightly inward, and should be forward enough that you are not able to see the toes</li>
<li>The back leg is naturally straight but not locked</li>
<li>Most of the body weight is placed on the front leg</li>

Sanchin-dachi, <i>Three Battle stance</i> - take a step into sanchin, facing leftwards
</p>

<p>
This is the most difficult stance to master and probably the most important
stance in Goju Ryu.  It is performed as follows:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Begin with heiko dachi, step one foot forward</li>
<li>The heel of the front foot should be on the same line as the toes of the back foot</li>
<li>The toes of both feet should turn inward slightly</li>
<li>The front foot is turned inward at about 20° angle</li>
<li>Tense your tandien, buttocks and thigh muscles and then pull the hips upwards</li>
<li>The knees should bend and turn inward</li>
<li>The feet should be placed firmly on the ground with the toes gripping the ground</li>
<li>The center of gravity should be at the midpoint between the two feet</li>
<li>Keep your back straight and your chin tucked in.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Sanchin kata, considered the core and most difficult kata in Goju Ryu is done entirely in the sanchin dachi stance.
</p></li>

<li>Zenkusti Dachi - Look right, then with right leg move into Zenkutsu, then
end-up facing rightwards with right leg at the front. Through-out the left
remains in-place, just pivoting.</li>

<li>Kokustu Dachi - to the left, but head still facing to the right</li>

<li>Zenkustu dachi - back to the right</li>

<li>Sanchin Dachi - take a step into sanchin, facing rightwards</li>

Hesoku-dachi, <i>feet together stance; informal attention stance</i> - right moves up to touch the left, then head faces to the
front center
</p>

<p>
In this stance, your back is straight and relaxed, your feet are placed
together, and the weight is equally distributed between the two feet.
</p></li>

<li>Zenkustu dachi - to the front center, with left leg leading</li>

<li><a href="https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-hachiji-dachi-Copy.jpg" class="tooltip" title="Image credit “https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-hachiji-dachi-Copy.jpg”"><img src="https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-hachiji-dachi-Copy.jpg" alt="Article image"

Hachiji-dachi, <i>Natural stance</i> - right leg takes a step forward, left follows, to end-up in a
should-width stance

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>This stance is close to the natural way people stand.</li>
<li>The feet are shoulder width apart, the toes point out at about 45°, the
body is relaxed and the knees are slightly bent.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Zenkustu Dachi - look over the left-shoulder, turn with left leg; end-up in

Neko Ashi Dachi, <i>Cat stance</i> - Bring the left back, with toes on ground, heel up.
</p>

<p>
To assume neko ashi dachi:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Start with musubi dachi (formal attention stance) and step forward for a distance of about one foot</li>
<li>Lower the hips deeply and transfer most of the body weight to the back leg</li>
<li>The front leg is bent and the heel of the front leg is raised slightly with only the toes and the ball of the front foot touches the ground</li>
<li>The back foot points outward at about 30 to 45 degree angle</li>
<li>About 90% of the body weight is placed on the back foot.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All weight rests on the back leg, which is bent at the knee.</li>
<li>The rear foot is turned at about 20-30 degrees out and the knee sits at
the same angle.</li>
<li>Only the toes of the front foot rest on the ground, positioned in front of
the back heel.</li>
<li>There is no weight on the front foot, and there is no bent in the ankle
joint - front knee, front shin, and the rise of the foot (but not the
toes) form a single line.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>
<a href="https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-bensoku-dachi-Copy.jpg" class="tooltip" title="Image credit “https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-bensoku-dachi-Copy.jpg”"><img src="https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-bensoku-dachi-Copy.jpg" alt="Article image"
             width="50" height="50" align="top"/></a>
Bensoku-dachi, <i>Cross-legged stance</i> - Drop the left down, toes pointing to the right. Right steps
towards the back right corner of the room. Finally, left leg slides behind
the right leg, ending with the heel up and the toes planted and facing the
right leg.
</p>

<p>
To assume bensoku dachi:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Cross one leg behind the other</li>
<li>Bend both knees</li>
<li>The front foot is placed firmly on the ground but only the ball of the back foot touches the ground</li>
<li>The knee of the back foot is nested against the back of the front knee.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Bensoku dachi is a transitional stance that is used when one needs to change
direction. It appears in kata like Seiyunchin and Sepai.
</p></li>

<li>Zenkustu with the right leg towards the back left of the room; the left leg
only pivots.</li>

<li>Neko Ashi Dachi - Bring the right leg back into a cat stance</li>

<li>Drop the right down and do a Bensoku Dachi</li>

<li><p>

Shiko-dachi, <i>Square Stance, Horse Stance, Straddle Leg Stance</i>
</p>

<p>
The left leg moves towards the back of the room, ending in a shiko dachi;
right leg remains where it is.
</p>

<p>
The toes face out at about 45 degrees. Knees point outward, and stance is often low.
</p>

<p>
To assume shiko dachi, start with hachiji dachi stance, turn the heels to
point the toes outward at about 45 degrees and lower the hips.
</p>

<p>
In this stance:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The feet are about two shoulder width apart</li>
<li>The big toes point outward diagonally at about 45 degrees</li>
<li>The knees are turned outward</li>
<li>The back is straight</li>
<li>The hips are lower than in kiba dachi and the thighs are almost parallel to the ground</li>
<li>The body weight is evenly distributed between the two legs</li>
<li>The soles of the feet are firmly in contact with the ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Shiko dachi is a great stance for developing lower body strength and stability.
</p></li>

<li>Look rightwards towards the center of the room, then do a shiko dachi
&#x2014;ending with body facing the right side of the room; i.e., right leg is in
the back.</li>

<li>Bring the back leg, the right leg, up to the front leg into a Musubu Dachi.</li>

<p>
In short: In English sometimes we mess-up between “I/me/my”, likewise in Arabic we might mess up with “ابو / ابا / ابي”:
These are just اب followed by one of ا/ي/و (which are the pronounced case endings!)
</p>

<div class="org-center">
<p>
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
</p>
</div>

<p>
How do Arabs say the English “a/an/the”, as in “an apple” or “the chair”? Easy! By default, all words are <i>indefinite</i>
(“a/an”); and made <i>definite</i> (“the”) by adding الـ to the front of the word.
</p>

<p>
But&#x2026; there's some subtleties, which first require us to discuss vowel markings&#x2026; which also change if the <i>feminine
marker</i> ة is used, so we also need to briefly discuss gender.
</p>

<p>
English relies on <i>word order</i> for meaning; for example, <i>Jim hit Bob</i> is a sentence where the person doing the action is
<i>Jim</i> and we know it has to be <i>Jim</i>, and not <i>Bob</i>, since <i>Jim</i> is the word <i>before</i> the action <i>hit</i>. However, in Arabic words can
be ordered in almost any way you like! Then how do we identifiy who does an action? We use <b><span style="color:green;">case markings</span></b>: We add small
symbols to the end of words to indiciate the role they play in a sentence.
</p>

<p>
With vowel markings, we can finally flesh-out the nature of
“a/an/the” in Arabic&#x2026; but then something wild happens if we stick
an (in)definite <i>followed by</i> a definite! We get the concepts of ownership and complete sentences that don't need a verb!
</p>

<p>
Finally, we conclude with an explanation of why in the world English Qurans use the single word <i>muslim</i> where's Arabic
Qurans use both مسلمون and مسلمين.
</p>


</div>

<p>
Some <b><span style="color:green;">interesting</span></b> concepts will also be mentioned, for those curious, but should be ignored on a first
reading. These will be hidden away in <i>clickable/foldable</i> regions.
</p>

<p>
These are notes of things that I'm learning; there's likely errors.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88">نحو</a> literally means <i>direction</i>; but <a href="https://altaysir.wordpress.com/2010/09/22/pkik9-ce/">when talking about Arabic grammar</a>, it means <i>syntax</i> (how words are combined to form
phrases) and, in-particular, case endings / إعراب.

<p>
Arabs <i>infer</i> vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ
“he was carried”.
</p>

<p>
As an example sentence with vowels written, Prophet Muhammad is known to have said:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left"><i>I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate</i></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Incidentally, Ali was the one who commissioned the system of vowels.

</p>

<hr />
<p>
Arabic has only three short vowels, or حركات (literally: “movements”), which are written as small symbols above/below
letters.

<p>
The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using
sukkun, هْهْهْهْ. It is important for consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, such as بَابْ “bab” which means <i>door.</i>
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, when a sound needs to be repeated twice, it is usually written once with a <i>Shadda</i> ـّـ to indicate the
doubling.  For example, فَهِمَ <i>fahima</i> “he understood” but فَهَّمَ <i>fahhama</i> “he explained”. Shadda is used with الـ + ‘sun
letters’. Unlike the other short vowels, the Shadda is usually written even in informal Arabic, to avoid ambiguity.
</p>


<p>
Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters <i>after</i> the short vowels:
</p>

<td class="org-left"><i>uu</i></td>
<td class="org-left">ـُو</td>
<td class="org-left"><i>boot</i></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels <i>aa,ii,uu</i> (when
preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds <i>a,y,w</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, as a consonant, <a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/74">ي</a> makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.</li>
<li>Occasionally, <i>aa</i> is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots), or یٰ, rather than an
<i>alif</i>. This always happens at the end of a word and is called <i>alif maqsuura</i>
“broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسیٰ “Musa”.</li>
</ul>

For example, “they (feminine) studied” is هُنَّ دَرَسْنَّ.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exercise: Conjugate <i>to study</i> دَرَسَ for each subject above.
( <a href="http://allthearabicyouneverlearnedthefirsttimearound.com/p1/p1-ch3/verbs-past-tense-and-the-accusative-case/">Answer</a> )</li>
<li>Exercise: Conjugate <i>to be generous</i> كَرُمَ and <i>to drink</i> شَرِبَ.</li>
<li>Exercise: What does درست mean?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Trick question!</i> You need the context, sentence, to <i>infer</i> the required
conjugation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>
Note that the conjugation for the third-person masculine, هُمْ/they,
is <i>not phonetic</i>: The ending ـُوا has the long vowel ـُو pronounced, but the alif is silent. E.g., <i>they studied</i> is هُمْ دَرَسُوا
and is read “hum darasuu”.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The personal pronouns (<i>I, you, they, etc</i>) are not usually used, since the verb conjugation tells us who the
subject is.  Sometimes they are used for emphasis.
E.g., <i>they studied</i> is دَرَسُوا
and is read “darasuu”.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Arabic has no “to X” form, as in English <i>to eat, to drink, etc</i>.  Instead, it uses the <i>he</i> form of a verb when referring
to a verb in-general.  For example, <i>he studied</i> دَرَسَ is used to mean <i>to study</i> when we are taking about how the verb <i>to
study</i> changes depending on who is doing the studying. This form is chosen since it is the <b>simplest form</b>: It's the main 3
root consontants of the verb, followed by a fatHa.

<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-center" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-center">Fatima helped Zaynab</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-center">نصرت فاطمةُ  زينبَ</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-center">نصرت زينبَ فاطمةُ</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-center">فاطمةُ نصرت زینبَ</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>
The way the listener knows what’s the subject and what’s the object is quite literally carried around with the nouns
themselves. The endings make all the difference.
</p>
<div class="org-center">
<span style="color:green;">
<p>
<b>This is <a href="http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=715,ll=2080,ls=5,la=2863,sg=701,ha=473,br=634,pr=104,vi=257,mgf=593,mr=420,mn=911,aan=407,kz=1608,uqq=237,ulq=1202,uqa=286,uqw=1064,umr=711,ums=591,umj=524,bdw=587,amr=425,asb=640,auh=1033,dhq=365,mht=591,msb=159,tla=70,amj=516,ens=28,mis=1439">اعراب</a>, <i>I'rab</i>, which <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B9_%D8%B1_%D8%A8#Derived_terms">literally</a> means “to Arabize” or

</p>

</span>
</div>

<p>
The second instance above might seem weird at first, since the object comes before the subject, but it is more common
when the object is an attached <abbr class="tooltip" title="A <em>pronoun</em> is a word that stands-in for a noun. For example, below we refer to someone<br>in 3 different ways:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <em>“His” cat saw “him”, and “he” jumped!</em><br><br>+ A <em>personal pronoun</em> replaces a noun that refers to a person (e.g., Jasim ate ≈ <em>he</em> ate),<br>+ while a <em>possessive pronoun</em> replaces a noun that involves ownership (e.g., Jasim's book ≈ <em>his</em> book),<br>+ and an <em>objective pronoun</em> replaces a noun that is having an action done to it (e.g., I saw Jasim ≈ I saw <em>him</em>.)<br><br><hr> Below are Arabic's <em>personal pronouns</em> alongside their English translations.<br><br>|&emsp;&emsp;| singular&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| plural&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|<br>| 1&emsp;| أنا&emsp; &emsp;I&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | نَحْن &emsp;we&emsp;&emsp; |<br>| 2m | أَنْتَ&emsp;  you&emsp;&emsp; | أَنْتُم &emsp;you&emsp;&emsp;|<br>| 2f | أَنْتِ&emsp;  you&emsp;&emsp; | أَنتُن &emsp;you&emsp;&emsp;|<br>| 3m | هُوَ&emsp;   he/it&emsp;| هُم&emsp;  they&emsp;|<br>| 3f | هِيَ&emsp;   she/it | هُنَّ&emsp;   they |<br><br><hr> In Arabic, <em>possessive and object pronouns</em> are <em>attached pronouns</em>; they are <strong>joined to the end</strong> of a word: For example,<br><em>house</em> بیت becomes <em>my house</em> بیتِي, and from <em>he helped</em> نَصَرَ we get نَصَرَني <em>he helped me</em>.<br>Arabic's object & possessive pronouns are the same, except for the “my/me” case.<br><br>|&emsp;&emsp;| singular&emsp;&emsp;| plural&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; |<br>| 1&emsp;| ـِي&emsp;  &emsp;my&emsp; | ـنَا&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;our&emsp;&emsp;|<br>| 2m | ـكَ&emsp;   your | ـكُمْ&emsp;&emsp;   your&emsp;|<br>| 2f | ـكِ&emsp;   your | ـكُنَّ&emsp;&emsp;  your&emsp;|<br>| 3m | ـَهُ&emsp;  &emsp;his&emsp;| ـهُمْ&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;their |<br>| 3f | ـَهَا&emsp; &emsp; hers | ـهُنَّ&emsp;  &emsp; their |">pronoun</abbr>:

<p>
This is a common example of the verb-object-subject word order!
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, in general, in Arabic the action word, <b>the verb</b>, can occur in the first
or second positions within a sentence whereas <b>the subject</b> (the person doing the
action) and <b>the object</b> (the thing/person being acted upon) can occur anywhere!
Here's another example:
</p>
<div style="padding: 1em;background-color: #CCFFCC;border-radius: 15px;font-size: 0.9em;"> <h3>Verbal sentences can have 4 different word orders</h3>
<p>
Below are 4 ways to say <b>Muhammad wrote the lesson</b> in Arabic!
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

I personally have never encountered the fourth/last form above when actually
talking Arabic to other people.
</p>

</div>

<details class="code-details"

                          box-shadow: 0.05em 0.1em 5px 0.01em  #00000057;">
                  <summary>
                    <strong>
                      <font face="Courier" size="3" color="green">
                         Um actually, it's more accurate to say: Verbs must be singular before subjects
                      </font>
                    </strong>
                  </summary>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Verbs can come before or after the subject, and the choice is largely a matter
of emphasis/level of formality.</li>

<li>However, Arabic verbs change according to the subject, such as whether it's
one person or multiple people doing the action.</li>

<li>If the subject is a group of people, the verb will be <i>singular</i> if it comes
<i>before</i> the subject. It will only change according to whether the subject is
masculine or feminine.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For example,
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-center" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-center">. كَتَبَتْ البَنات خِطابات، ثُمَّ خَرَجْنَ</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-center">The girls wrote letters and then went out.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Here كَتَبَتْ/wrote is a <i>singular feminine</i> form of the verb كَتَبَ/to-write since <i>it
comes before the subject</i>, which is البَنات/the-girls.  Likewise, خَرَجْنَ/went-out
is a <i>plural feminine</i>, since it comes after the subject.
</p>


</details>

<p>
Finally, as we will encounter later in this article, Arabic also has <i>sentences
without verbs</i>! These are just the subject followed by <b>the predicate</b>, which is
what is happening to the subject. Since these non-verbal sentences are only two
pieces (possibly complicated pieces), there are two ways to order them and both
are valid!

This <i>words-changing-due-to-role</i> behaviour also happens in English, but mostly with <abbr class="tooltip" title="A <em>pronoun</em> is a word that stands-in for a noun.

<span style="color:orange;">me</span>   ≈   <span style="color:orange;">I</span> was seen by <span style="color:purple;">him</span></i>.
</p>

<p>
In English, there are 3 ways to refer to oneself: <b><span style="color:green;">I</span>, <span style="color:red;">me</span>, <span style="color:blue;">my</span></b>.
For example,
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left"><b><span style="color:blue;">My</span></b> cat saw <b><span style="color:red;">me</span></b>, and <b><span style="color:green;">I</span></b> jumped!</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Here's the rules:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>(Nominative!)</i> When I am doing something, I say: <b><span style="color:green;"> I did it.</span></b></li>
<li><i>(Accusative!)</i> When something is being done to me, I say: <b><span style="color:red;"> It was done to me.</span></b></li>
<li><i>(Genitive!)</i> When I have an item, I say: <b><span style="color:blue;"> My thing....</span></b></li>
</ul>

<p>
So the word used to refer to <i>myself</i> changes depending on what is happening <b><span style="color:green;">by</span></b> me, <b><span style="color:red;">to</span></b> me, or <b><span style="color:blue;">of</span></b> me / what I
own.

                         Um, actually there's a 4th way: myself!
                      </font>
                    </strong>
                  </summary>
<p>
<i>Myself</i> is the forth way to refer to oneself in English. Like <b><span style="color:red;">me</span></b>, it is used when something is being done to me <i>such that</i>
the person doing the action is also me &#x2026;err, myself.
</p>

<p>
Here are some examples,
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left">I care for myself, by running everyday.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">I describe myself as happy.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">I like myself.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
As a rule of thumb, <i>myself</i> should only be used if <i>I</i> is used in the same sentence. Otherwise, just use <i>me</i>.

<p>
More accurately, <span style="color:blue;">the genitive case</span> is used when a word follows a preposition <b>and</b>
it is used for all words after the first word in a possessive phrase &#x2014;which is
known as <abbr class="tooltip" title="Idafa, إظافة, is Arabic's version of the English <em>possessive 's</em>, a way of quickly<br>introducing the preposition “of”: English has <em>Jim's apple</em>, whereas Arabic would<br>say <em>the apple (of) Jim</em>.<br><br>Incidentally, English also simply places two nouns next to each other to form<br>possession: “the kitchen table” ---or طبلةُ المطبخِ. This is because English's<br>possessive <em>'s</em> is only used with animate non-things.<br><br>Idafa is a noun phrase, and so can be iterated onto itself to create complex<br>possessions: For example,<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; سَرْقةُ جَوازِ سَفَرِ أِحَدِ اللاعِبِينَ<br><em>the theft of the passport [literally ''license of journey''] of one of the athletes</em><br><br><hr><br><strong>Case endings for Idafa: Only one of “a/the/my”!</strong><br><br>The first term of an Idafa will be in any case the sentence requires; and <em>only<br>the last term</em> in an Idafa (however complex) can have the definite article <em>or</em><br>nunation <em>or</em> an attached possessive pronoun ---this is like English, <em>“a X's Y”</em> or<br><em>“the X's Y”</em> or <em>“my X's Y”</em>--- and this choice determines the definiteness of the<br>Idafa. Also, all terms of an Idafa, other than the first term, <strong>must</strong> be in the<br>genitive case: Ending with ـِـ or ـٍـ .<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | <strong>a</strong> nurse's book&emsp; | كتابُ مُمرّضةٍ&emsp;|<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | <strong>the</strong> nurse's book | كتابُ ٱلْمُمرظةِ |<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | <strong>my</strong> nurse's book&emsp;| كتابُ مُمرّضتي |<br><br>Note that nunnation is indefinite, whereas الـ and possessive-pronouns are definite.">إظافة</abbr> in Arabic, covered below. [Idafa is Arabic's way of quickly
introducing possession without the preposition “of”: English has <i>Jim's apple</i>,
whereas Arabic would say <i>(the) apple (of) Jim</i>, تفاحة جیم .]
</p>

<p>
<b>Nunation/تنوين/Tanween:</b> When the word is indefinite, one “doubles” the symbols, which causes an extra <i>-n</i> sound to each
vowel: u ـُـ, a ـَـ, i ـِـ are replaced by un ـٌـ, an ـًـ, in ـٍـ. (If a word does not end in ة, the ـًـ ending is written اً.)

<div style="padding: 1em;background-color: #CCFFCC;border-radius: 15px;font-size: 0.9em;"> <h3>What does      كتاب المدرس الجدید في المكتب     mean?</h3>
<p>
Hopefully by the end of this article, you'll be able to guess the missing
short vowels. However, the word الجديد could be correctly vowelised in 2 ways,
according to the 2 nouns we have (<i>teacher</i> and <i>book</i>) and it's not clear which one
is the correct one!
</p>

<p>
What do the following sentences mean?

<p>
Here is a vague explanation, that can only make sense when the concepts
mentioned have already been understood &#x2014;and they are covered later on in this article.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>In the first sentence we have a <b>new book</b> since the word <b>new</b> الجدیدُ has the same
case ending as كتابُ: This is called nominative or مرفو and denoted by ـُـ.
(Note: <b>new</b> starts with الـ since كتاب is definite, since it the start of an Idaafa.)</li>

<li>In the second sentence we have a <b>new teacher</b> since the word <b>new</b> الجدیدِ has the same case ending as المُدرّسِ: This is
called genitive or مجرور and denoted by ـِـ.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Without the case markings, you'll have to rely on context and common sense.
</p>

<p>
Otherwise, the number and plurality of the adjective (if any) would match
that of the word it is describing. For example, in مقالة المدرس الجدیدة we know to
read this as <i>the teacher's new article</i> since the words <i>new</i> and <i>article</i> both have the
same feminine gender.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Formality-When-do-we-see-these-markings">
<p>
Depending on the formality of some Arabic text, such as Classical Arabic or Quranic Arabic, you might see and hear
additional grammatical endings.
</p>

<p>
In this article, we'll see that these endings &#x2014;even when not explicitly written as markings&#x2014;
do alter the writing of words in certain situations. For example,
درست كتابا has its markings guessed to be
دَرَسْتُ كِتَاباً <b><i>“<span style="color:green;">I</span> studied <span style="color:red;">a book</span>”</i></b> &#x2014;the extra alif is really the alif-tanween of the accusative case, اً.

What do you think the following English sentences say?
</p>

<style> #g751 {color: orange; background-color:orange;}
       #g751:hover {color: black; background-color:white;} </style>
<blockquote>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Y cn prbbly rd ths sly dspt th lck f vwls!
</p>

<p>
<span id="g751"> You can probably read this easily despite the lack of vowels! </span>
</p></li>

<li><p>

</p>

<p>
<span id="g751"> Yes, you can live without vowels! You can even write English without them; it only needs some practice and the result is drastically shorter sentences! If need be, like Arabic, use vowels only when there is ambiguity. </span>
</p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>
It might seem weird, for an English speaker, for vowels to be left-out, but conversely an Arabic speaker might think it's
extra effort in English to write out every vowel. It's different cultures, and traditions.
</p>

<p>
Just as it's a bit funny to drop the vowels in English, we can drop the dots in Arabic and the result is still somewhat
readable! In-fact, old Arabic did not have dots written down!

Arabic nouns (words that name people, objects, or ideas) are classified as
<i>masculine</i> مُذَكَّر (“mudhakkar”) or <i>feminine</i> مُؤَنَّث (“mu'annath”).
This classification affects how other words in a sentence are written, such as action words or descriptive words.
</p>

<div style="padding: 1em;background-color: #CCFFCC;border-radius: 15px;font-size: 0.9em;"> <h3>Arabic Gender Rule</h3>

<p>
In general, <i>if a word ends in ة or refers to a female <span class="underline">person</span>, then it is a feminine word; otherwise it is a masculine
word.</i>
</p>

<p>
In more detail:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Words that end with the “feminine ending marker” ة are مُؤَنَّث.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The ة is known as the <i>Taa Marbuta</i> (literally: “tied-up ت”) and it is pronounced as a short vowel <i>a</i> sound.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Words referring to female <i>people</i> but not ending in ة are مُؤَنَّث.</li>

<li>Most country names, natural features, and parts of the body that come in pairs are مُوَّنَّث.</li>

<li>Everything else is مُذَكَّر</li>

There are a few masculine words with the ة ending, but the only common on is خَلِيفَة “khalifa”. In the Quran this word has
the strict seance of <i>successor</i> or <i>viceroy</i>. In later times, this was generalised to <i>caliph</i>.

<dt>Example #1</dt><dd>The Taa Marbuta is special in contrast to the other letters: It can only be written at the end of a word, either
unjoined as ة or joined as ـَـة:

<li>It is purely a grammatical letter, it has no sound!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is the ending of most singluar feminine nouns/adjectives, or nouns referring to female people.</li>

<li>It <i>always</i> follows a Fatha vowel, as in جدَة or غرفَة, and so people would say ة makes a short <i>a</i> sound &#x2014;but this is
really due to the vowel that always comes before ة!</li>

So, it seems a word can have <b>exactly one</b> of “a/the/my”, that is, it can be
either indefinite <i>with</i> tanween, definite with <i>al</i>, or possessed (by a pronoun or an Idafa, covered below).

When <b>I</b> am talking, the speaker is the “first person” (“1”);
when taking <b>about you</b>, then you are the “second person”
and may be masculine (“2m”) or feminine (“2f”), or a group of you (“plural”);
finally, when talking about someone who is <b>not here</b> in the conversation,
they are in the “third person” (“3m, 3f”).

Possessive pronouns are the equivalent of the English <i>my, his, ours, &#x2026;</i>.
In Arabic, they are <b>joined to the end</b> of a word: For example,
<i>house</i> بیت becomes <i>my house</i> بیتِي.

Technically, Arabic does not have an indefinite article like English's <i>a/an</i>.  Instead, indefininte/nonspecific words
have <i>doubled case markings</i>: So instead of ـِـ ـُـ ـَـ we have ـٍـ ـٌـ ـًـ, where the second marking is pronounced as a ن/n
sound.  This is known as تنوین/Tanween, or <i>nunation</i>, which means <i>pronouncing the letter ن at the end of a word</i>, or <i>putting a nun/ن on</i>.
(Often the double ـُـ is written as one ـُـ with a tail: ـٌـــ.)

There is no indefinite article equivalent to the English “a/an”.  However, the large majority of nouns and adjectives
have <i>tanween</i> (the addition of the sound <i>n</i>) to the final vowel of a word) to indicate that the word is indefinite:

<p>
However, in everyday, non-vowelised, Arabic there is no separate word/marking for “a/an”, as in “a chair” or “an apple”.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>By default, words are <i>indefinite</i>: For example, مكتب means “an office”, even though there is no separate word for the

<li><p>
To make a noun <i>definite</i> we add الـ “al” <i>joined</i> to it, which means “the”.

<p>
I will use <i>directed addition symbols</i> ⇸ and ⇷ to mean the same
as “+” but also to indicate the direction one should read it.
For example, <i>X + Y</i> could mean <i>X Y</i> in English's left-to-right reading, but it could also mean <i>Y X</i> in Arabic's
right-to-left reading. Whereas <i>X ⇷ Y</i> can only mean <i>X Y (read right-to-left)</i>.

If الـ “al” comes directly after a vowel, the “a” of “al” الـ will drop out, or elide, leaving just the “l” sound. This
only affects pronunciation and not the spelling.

<p>
Nouns starting with certain letters of the Arabic alphabet cause the pronunciation of “al” الـ to change: The “l” sound
becomes the same as the first sound of the noun. This double-pronunciation of the first letter of the noun is indicated
with a Shadda ـّـ symbol, if vowel marks are written.

<p>
For example,
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<tr>
<td class="org-left">the car</td>
<td class="org-left">السّيّارة</td>
<td class="org-left">“as-sayyara”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Notice that السّيّارة is <b>not</b> read “al-sayyara”! The “l” sound changes to be the sound of the first letter of سيّارة, namely
“s”.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, <i>a river</i> is نهر whereas <i>the river</i> is النّهر “an-nahr”.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
The letters which cause this pronunciation assimilation are called
<b>sun letters</b>, الحروف الشمسية “al-huruf ash-shamsiyya”, as ش/sh is itself an assimilating letter. Half of Arabic's 28 letters are Sun Letters.
The remaining half of the letters are called Moon Letters,
الحروف القمرية “al-huruf al-gamariyya”, as ق/G is not an assimilating letter.

<p>
Just as we use a shadda ـّـ on a sun letter, we place a sukoon ـْـ on the ل when it comes after moon letters: For example,
اَلْقمر “al-qamar” &#x2014;the sukoon gives us a slight pause after the “l” sound.
</p>

<p>
The above two rules are explained by the following theoretical justification.
</p>

                         Um, actually the definite article is really just لْ

                    </strong>
                  </summary>
<p>
In fact, the definite article is in essence simply a لْ, an “l” sound. But as Arabic phonetic theory holds that words
cannot begin with an unvowelled consonant, the vowel <i>a</i> (Fatha) is added to the لْ to give اَلْ, <i>al</i>. Theory holds that this
<i>a</i> vowel is not an integral part of the definite article and is required when no other vowel precedes the article
<i>l</i>. In effect this means that the added vowel is only at the beginning of a sentence. In other places, the vowel Fatha is
replaced by a “joining sign” (<i>wasla</i>) to obtain ٱلـ, which tells you to link the <i>l</i> of the definite article to the final
vowel of the preceding word.
</p>

<p>
In short, you will find اَلْـ at the beginning, and ٱلْـ elsewhere in the sentence. The use of the two can be seen as
follows:

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Note: In front of Sun Letters, اَلـ is written with <i>no sukkun</i> on the ل, since there is no pause on the ل; in-fact the ل
is assimilated and makes a different sound altogether.
</p>

<p>
We will get to sentence formation, later below.

In the Quran, when the definite article is prefixed to a word
beginning with ل, only one ل is written. For example,

😉 <b>Arabic is so simple!</b>
Unlike other languages, Arabic has الـ for <i>the</i> regardless of whether we're talking about
one person, or many! For example, in French, we have 3-ways to say <i>the</i>: <i>le, la, les</i>.

For example, a person named <i>John</i> who happens to be a smith, a worker in metal, might be referred to as <i>John the
smith</i>. In English, this became <i>John Smith</i>, and in Arabic it becomes <i>جون الحداد</i> “john al-hadad” &#x2014;where حداد means
<i>smith</i>.

A more important figure would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasan_al-Askari">حسن العسكري</a>: A person named حسن/Hassan who lived in a town of soldiers/عسكر. He is a
great grandson of Prophet Muhammad.

Since <b>the</b> <span style="color:green;">possessed</span> item is <i>known</i> to belong to the <span style="color:red;">possessor</span>, the English translations all use “the” before
the <span style="color:green;">possessed</span> item: <i>The <span style="color:green;">X</span> of <span style="color:red;">Y</span></i>. That is, just as in English <i><span style="color:red;">Y's</span> <span style="color:green;">X</span></i> means <i>X</i> is known to
<span class="underline">definitely</span> belong to <i>Y</i>, Arabic treats the <span style="color:green;">possessed</span> word in an إظافة as “definite in meaning” (even though it is
not “definite in form; has no الـ”); see example #3 above. We can summarise this
observation as follows.

Technically, we can treat “her book” as an Idaafa construction, with the pronoun
“her”, written in Arabic as an attached ending ـها, being the second term in the
Idafa. Since pronouns are technically
definite, they will always end an Idafa whenever they are used.

<p>
As always, definitness in an Idafa distinguishes between a complete sentence and an adjectival phrase:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />
</colgroup>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">This <i>is a</i> book.</td>
<td class="org-left">.هذا كتاب</td>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">This book …</td>
<td class="org-left">… هذا الكتاب</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">(This book is heavy.</td>
<td class="org-left">.هذا الكتاب ثقیل )</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">This <i>is</i> <span class="underline">the</span> book.</td>
<td class="org-left">.هذا هو الكتاب</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
The first is a sentence, the second is not.  Finally, notice that you need to add the appropriate noun, in this case هو,
if you want to say the sentence <i>This is <span class="underline">the</span> book.</i>
(This is the <i>Pronoun of Separation</i>, discussed below.)

in an Idafa construction with an adjective, a descriptive word?
<b>We get sentences!</b>

<p>
Notice that the description جميل changes according to what is being described: The first has an extra ة since it's
describing a female, the third (and fifth) has markings that match the markings of what's being described, the fourth (and sixth!)
is definite since it's describing something definite.

<p>
Adjectives are placed after the noun they describe, and agree with
the noun in gender, definiteness, number, and case endings.

Just place them after the noun, as usual, and seperate them with <i>and</i> وَ “wa”. Here's two examples, one definite and the
other indefinite.

In the English <b>sentence</b> <i>Allah is powerful and mighty.</i>, it is necessary to link the adjectives by using <i>and</i>. This is
not necessary in Arabic &#x2014;even though وَ could be used&#x2014;, especially when tanween is fully pronounced. For example:

<li>Notice that all colours start with أ and have a Fatha ـَـ on the next-to-last letter.</li>

Even though adjectives must agree with their nouns in case endings, colours are an exception: They always have the ـُـ

<p>
The rule about agreement in definiteness is crucial, because a definite noun followed by an indefinite adjective is a
complete sentence, not requiring a verb.  That is, mixing definiteness results in <i>sentences</i>, complete thoughts.
</p>
<div class="org-center">
<p>
<b>Non-verbal Sentences      ≈    <span style="color:red;">indefinite description</span> ⇷ <span style="color:green;">defininite noun</span></b>
</p>
</div>
<p>
For example,
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left" />

<col  class="org-left" />

<p>
Again, since Arabic's word classes put adjectives and nouns in the same group, اسم, we can replace the adjective with a
noun. For example,
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

These kind of no-verb sentences are also known as <i>equational sentences</i>: For example, <i>You are Muhammad</i> is written أنتَ
مهمد and “could be thought of as” <i>you = Muhammad</i> &#x2014;an equation!  Likewise, <i>Muhammad = student</i> is another equation,

<li>هم مُدرّسون  &#x2014; <i>They are teachers.</i></li>

<p>
<b>Exercise 2:</b>
(1) Pick any name you like, (2) pick any job/adjective you like, then (3)
stick them beside each other to make more example sentences!
</p>

<p>
Here are a few to get you started!
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>زينب كاتبة &#x2014; <i>Zaynab is a writer.</i></li>
<li>سارة طويلة &#x2014; <i>Sarah is tall.</i></li>
<li>بنيامين مسرور &#x2014; <i>Benjamin is happy.</i></li>
</ul>


</details>

<p>
Notice how cool that is! Arabic let's us create sentences without an equivalent for <i>am, is, are</i> &#x2014;the subject is just
followed by the rest of the sentence. Moreover, notice that since <b>subjects must have the nominative ending ـُـ/ـٌـ, the
rest of the sentence matches in case</b> &#x2014;this is the same rule of matching for adjectives! (For this reason, non-verbal
sentences are also called <i>nominal sentences</i>.)

English makes sentences <i>into</i> question by moving words around:
The sentence <i>You are a student.</i> becomes the question
<i>Are you a student?</i>
</p>

<p>
Arabic just adds هَلْ or اَ to a non-verbal sentence to turn it into a question:
For example, <i>You are a student</i> is انتَ طالب, and we turn it into a question as follows.

following verb.

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>كم</dt><dd><p>
كم is followed by an indefinite <i>singular</i> noun that must be in the accusative case; i.e., it ends with ـًـ if the word
ends with ة/ی/اء and otherwise ends with اً.
</p>

<p>
This is another example of Arabic case endings, اعراب, affecting the basic spelling
and pronunciation.
</p>

<p>
For example, كم ولداَ؟ <i>How many boys?</i>
</p></dd>

<dt>من</dt><dd><p>
The question word <i>who</i> مَنْ  “men” (as in “gentlemen”) can be easily confused
with the preposition <i>from</i> مِنْ. “min” (as in “minimum”). Unless the vowels are written, it's the context that
distinguishes them apart.
</p>

<p>
For example,

<td class="org-center">مِنْ أَیْنَ انتَ؟</td>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Likewise, من انت؟ only means <i>Who are you?</i> (“men anta”),

<p>
If you want to make a nominal sentence negative, you need to use the special verb Laysa.
</p>

<p>
While Arabic doesn't use a verb “to be” (<i>is/am/are</i>) in simple non-verbal sentences,
it does have a verb “to <i>not</i> be”!
</p>

<p>
We make a sentence, such as <i>Haani is a doctor</i> هاني طبیب, negative by adding
لَیْسَ (and concluding the sentence in the accusative case)
or by adding لِیْسَ…بِـ (and concluding in the genitive case).

<td class="org-left">. لِیْسَ هاني طبيباً</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">. لِيْسَ هاني بِطبيب</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
لِيْسَ is unusual because it looks like a past verb, but always has a present meaning:
<i>Haani <span class="underline">wasn't</span> a doctor</i> would be لم یكن هاني طبیباً.
</p>

<p>
However, لِیْسَ does change according to the subject:

The adjective will match the gender of the noun it is describing,

Answer&#x2026;
</p>

<style> #g756 {color: orange; background-color:orange;}
       #g756:hover {color: black; background-color:white;} </style>
<p>
<span id="g756"> It's not clear! Such ambiguities also exist in English! For example, “the boy touched the girl with the flower”: Does this mean the boy used a flower to touch the girl, or does it mean the boy touched the specific girl who had a flower with her. </span>
</p>



<p>
However&#x2026; Arabic has markings, or اعراب which literally means
“to make clear, eloquent”. As such, if we use markings, we can remove the ambiguity.

<div style="padding: 1em;background-color: #CCFFCC;border-radius: 15px;font-size: 0.9em;"> <h3>Adjective Agreement</h3>
<p>
Adjectives are placed after the noun they describe, and agree with
the noun in gender, definiteness, and case endings.

<p>
The <i>second</i> noun in an Idafa (and any subsequent nouns) will have
the genetive case ending: Either ـِـ if definite, or ـٍـ if indefinite.
(The case of the first noun will vary depending on the role it plays within the sentence.)

As such, we have:

In English to talk about <i>many</i> instance of a “house” or a “mouse” we use the words “houses” and “mice”. In Arabic, one

to form the plural.

For groups of females, or (female or male) <i>non-human</i> nouns, we form the plural by adding ـَـات at the end of a word &#x2014;which is essentially just <i>expanding</i> any existing ـَـة.

Notice that the Arabic word for <i>animals</i> is grammatically feminine.

descriptive words are singular for <i>animals</i>, but plural for <i>teachers</i>.

<p>
Since this plural explicitly indicates a case, either nomative
with  ـُـونَ and otherwise with ـِـينَ;
but the <i>second</i> noun (and any subsequent nouns) in an Idafa
must be in the genetive case. As such, in an Idafa whose <i>final</i> word is a
sound masculine plural, the ـِـينَ ending is always used.
Moreover, when this plural is the <i>first</i> word in an Idafa,
it loses the shared ending ـنَ.

<p>
In an Idafa, the first noun is definite (even when it does not start with الـ): In <i>X's Y</i>, we know that <i>Y</i> belongs to <i>X</i>,
and so it's not some arbitrary unknown <i>Y</i>. As such, the first noun in an Idafa can only have the defininte case endings ـَ
ـِ ـُ and not the indefinite ones ـَ ـٍ ـٌ . It is for this reason that the final ـنَ ending of the SMP must be dropped when a
SMP is the first noun in an Idafa.

<p>
I want to quickly introduce the Arabic language, through its “root system” &#x2014;i.e., most words have 3-letters at their
core&#x2014; and how these roots can be placed in “patterns” to obtain new words.
</p>

<p>
I'd like to take a glance at Arabic's Verb Forms: These give you 10 words for each root!
</p>

<p>
Some <b><span style="color:green;">interesting</span></b> concepts will also be mentioned, for those curious, but should be ignored on a first
reading. These will be hidden away in <i>clickable/foldable</i> regions.
</p>

<p>
These are notes of things that I'm learning; there's likely errors.

<p>
Most Arabic words are derived from a three-letter <abbr class="tooltip" title="The Arabic language is based on “roots” that link words of related meanings.<br><br>An Arabic “root” is the sequence of (usually 3) Arabic letters that carry the underlying meaning of a word, for example<br>ش−ر−ب “to drink” and ح−م−ل “to carry”.<br><br>Vowels and consonants are added around the roots to create related words.<br><em>Roots are the building blocks of the Arabic language and are helpful for guessing the meaning of vocabulary.</em><br><br>Generally foreign loan words, such as <em>internet</em> انترنت, fall outside the root system.">root</abbr> &#x2014;notable exceptions are words like “and” وَ
and “on” علی.  A root, or مصدر “masdar”, refers to the core meaning of a word.  Simply put, roots are identified by
ignoring all non-vowel letters, resulting in usually 3 letters &#x2014;and, rarely, 4 letters.  <i>Roots are the building
blocks of the Arabic language and are helpful for guessing the meaning of vocabulary.</i>
</p>

<p>
For example, the sequence of letters س−ف−ر (read right-to-left as s-f-r) carries the meaning of “travel”.
Any word containing these letters, in this order, likely has something to do with travel. For example:

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">embassy</td>
<td class="org-left">سفارة</td>
<td class="org-left">sifara</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
All of these words are derived from the root س−ف−ر, s-f-r, in this order.
<i>Much of Arabic grammar is concerned with how the root is manipulated to create different related meanings:
Additional letters, or vowels, modify the meaning according to different general patterns.</i>

</p>

<p>
Likewise, ك−ت−ب is a root regarding “writing”, from which we can obtain numerous words:

<p>
For example the letters ح−م−ل have the meaning of “to carry” but naively connecting the letters gives us حمل, which,
without any context, could be read as
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>حَمَلَ “he carried”, or</li>
<li>حُمِلْ “he was carried”!
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>(<abbr class="tooltip" title="Arabs <em>infer</em> vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ<br>“he was carried”.<br><br>As an example sentence with vowels written, Prophet Muhammad is known to have said:<br>| أنَا مَدِينَةُ الْعِلْمِ وَعَلَيٌ بَابُهَا&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|<br>| <em>I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate</em> |<br><br>Incidentally, Ali was the one who commissioned the system of vowels.<br>https://blogs.transparent.com/arabic/the-beginning-of-dotting-and-diacritics-in-arabic/<br><br><hr><br>Arabic has only three short vowels, or حركات (literally: “movements”), which are written as small symbols above/below<br>letters.<br><br>| Vowel name&emsp;| Vowel sound | Arabic | English example |<br>| Fatha;&emsp;فتحة&emsp;| <em>a</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | ـَ&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | <em>mat</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; |<br>| Dhamma; ظمّة&emsp;| <em>u</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | ـُ&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | <em>sugar</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; |<br>| Kasra; كسرة&emsp;| <em>i</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | ـِ&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; | <em>bit</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; |<br><br>The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using<br>sukkun, هْهْهْهْ. It is important for consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, such as بَابْ “bab” which means <em>door.</em><br><br>Incidentally, when a sound needs to be repeated twice, it is usually written once with a <em>Shadda</em> ـّـ to indicate the<br>doubling.&emsp;For example, فَهِمَ <em>fahima</em> “he understood” but فَهَّمَ <em>fahhama</em> “he explained”. Shadda is used with الـ + ‘sun<br>letters’. Unlike the other short vowels, the Shadda is usually written even in informal Arabic, to avoid ambiguity.<br><br><br>Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters <em>after</em> the short vowels:<br> | Long vowel&emsp;sound | Arabic | English example |<br> | <em>aa</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| ـَا&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| <em>far</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; |<br> | <em>ii</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| ـِي&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| <em>meet</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|<br> | <em>uu</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| ـُو&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| <em>boot</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|<br><br>Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels <em>aa,ii,uu</em> (when<br>preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds <em>a,y,w</em>.<br> + For example, as a consonant, ي (https://arabic.fi/letters/74) makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.<br> + Occasionally, <em>aa</em> is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots), or یٰ, rather than an<br>&emsp; <em>alif</em>. This always happens at the end of a word and is called <em>alif maqsuura</em><br>&emsp; “broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسیٰ “Musa”.<br><br>The following video reads all Arabic letters, where each letter is vowelised by one of the 3 short vowels. It's a really<br>nice video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1Cl6W8EEBQ?start=6.">Vowel signs ـْ ـَ ـِ ـُ</abbr> are discussed below.)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
Both of these words are specific to
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a male person,</li>
<li>in the past, and</li>
<li>it's not clear whether the person is doing the carrying or the one being carried.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Thus حمل is far more specific than the general meaning of ح−م−ل “to carry” &#x2014;which is not itself a word, but an abstract
sequence of letters.

Irregular roots do not consist of 3 different consonants; instead, they fall into three categories:
</p>

<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Doubled roots</dt><dd><p>
where the second and third root letters are the
same.
</p>

<p>
− If a doubled verb is put into a form involving a sukkun ـْـ
  on the 3rd root, then the 2nd and 3rd letters are written
  separately; otherwise, the 2nd and 3rd letters are written together
  with a shadda ـّـ.
</p>

<p>
− For example, ر−د−د “to reply” becomes رَدَّ “he replied” when placed in the
  masculine-second-person-past-tense form فَعَلَ, but becomes رَدَدْتُ “I replied” when placed in the
  first-person-past-tense form فَعَلْتُ. <span style="color:red;">More on forms below!</span>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In doubt: Doubled roots are usually written together.</li>
</ul></dd>

<dt>Weak roots</dt><dd><p>
where one of the three root letters is و or ي; for example ق−و−ل “to speak”.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>These letters are “so weak” that they change from the constant sounds و/w and ي/y to vowel
sounds or disappear entirely, depending on the pattern the root is placed in.</li>
</ul>
<p>
− If و‌/ي is the first root, then it almost always drops out in the present tense.
  For example, و−ص−ل “to arrive” becomes أَصِلُ “I arrive” in the first-person-present-tense
  أَفْعُلُ form. Contrast this with the regular root ك−ت−ب “to write” becoming أَكْتُبُ “I write”.
</p></dd>

<dt>Hamzated roots</dt><dd>where one of the root letters is hamza ء; for example ق−ر−ء “to read”.</dd>

<i>What are the vowels that can be added to roots to make new words?</i>
</p>

<p>
Arabic has 28 letters, and like cursive English, it is written with letters connected.
</p>

<p>
Each letter has 4 forms: The isolated form, the form where the letter starts a word, the form where the letter is in the
middle of a word, and the form where a letter is at the end of a word. So, Arabic has 28 * 4 = 112 distinct shapes for
its alphabet.  (Since some letters do not connect forwards, the isolated form actually does appear in written text.  For
example, او means “or” and it consists of two isolated letters.)  For example, the letter <i>ha</i> has the following forms:

<p>
If a friend texts you something funny, you reply with ههههه −−− “hahaha”.

But, where are the short vowels “a”? <b>Arabic short vowels are generally not written!</b>
</p>

<p>
There are only three short vowels in Arabic: <i>a</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>u</i>.
They are denoted by small symbols above/below letters, for example:
</p>
<table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">

<col  class="org-left" />

</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left">ـِـ</td>
<td class="org-left">هِهِهِهِ</td>
<td class="org-left">hihihihi</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Incidentally, the sound “h” is obtained by using the “no vowel” marker: هْـ.  So with the 3 short vowels and the fourth
symbol to indicate the absence of a vowel, there are a total of 4 * 28 = 112 sounds in Arabic.

Arabs <i>infer</i> vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ
“he was carried”.

Arabic has only three short vowels, or حركات (literally: “movements”), which are written as small symbols above/below
letters.

The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using
sukkun, هْهْهْهْ.
</p>

<p>
Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters <i>after</i> the short vowels:

<p>
Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels <i>aa,ii,uu</i> (when
preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds <i>a,y,w</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, as a consonant, <a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/74">ي</a> makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.</li>
<li>Occasionally, <i>aa</i> is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots), or یٰ, rather than an
<i>alif</i>. This always happens at the end of a word and is called <i>alif maqsuura</i>
“broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسیٰ “Musa”.</li>
</ul>

<i>Of-course, there is more to the story!</i> There is the “glottal stop”, Hamza ـٔ , and other special characters and symbols
above/below letters.  So the counts of 112 are not exact.  For example, some letters, like alif ا, have the same shape
for different forms, but sometimes it can be written as ی (such as علی “on”) یٰ (such as موسیٰ “Musa”).

<li>In both cases there is uncertaininty as to when and how to use it, even among native speakers.</li>
<li>Whereas in English we ask ourselves: <i>Should the apostrophe come before the “s” or after the “s”?</i>, in Arabic the
question becomes: <i>Which letter should carry the hamza?</i>.</li>
<li>The hamza itself is considered a consonant, not a vowel, pronounced as a short pause.</li>
<li>Like the apostrophe, the rules for hamza are more concerned with where to place it than how to pronounce it.</li>
<li>General rules:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>At the start of a word, hamza is written on an alif: أ</li>
<li>This might result in two alifs side-by-side, if so then merge them
into <i>alif madda</i> آ, which is read as a long <i>aa</i> sound.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the letter carrying the hamza tends to relate to the vowel <i>before</i> the hamza:
If we have ـُـ ، ـِـ ، ـَـ before the hamza, then the hamza is written ؤ ، یٔ/ـٔـ ، أ respectively.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we have ـْـ before the hamza, we write ؤ ، یٔ/ـٔـ ، أ
depending on the vowel the hamza root should be taking.
For example, س−ء−ل “to ask” becomes يسْأَل “he asks” in the
masculine-second-person-present-tense (يَفْعَلُ form, for this
particular root).</li>

<p>
As a symbol to represent the three root letters of any word, Arabic grammar uses the roots of the prototypical verb فعل
“to do”, read <i>fa'al</i>.
</p>

<p>
For example, the root ك−ت−ب is associated with “writing”.  The word for “office” مَكْتَب is the مَفْعَل-pattern: The root
letters have مَـ before them, a sukkun ـْـ over the first root letter, and a fatha ـَـ over the second root letter. In the
same way, “books” كُتُب is the فُعُل-pattern.

The richness of Arabic is based on its system of word roots, and nowhere is this more evident than in the verb system. <a href="https://i0.wp.com/oerabic.llc.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Visual-Communication-Signs-IRAQI-22.png" class="tooltip" title="Agree"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/oerabic.llc.ed.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Visual-Communication-Signs-IRAQI-22.png" height=50></a>

<p>
In English we can add extra letters to form different but connected meanings &#x2014;for example: <i>value, revalue, validate</i>.
Arabic takes this principle much farther with many different patterns that add meaning to the origninal root form.
These <i>derived</i> forms are the major way in which Arabic achieves its richness of vocabulary. For example, from ق−ت−ل “to
kill”, we can obtain

I've often seen introductions to Arabic mention the power of roots &amp; patterns, but one usually has to work through a
host of fundamental topics before actually seeing some of these patterns.
</p>

<p>
I've written this brief introduction so that one can actually see some of these patterns in action.
</p>

<p>
It's been a lot of fun &#x2014;I had to learn a lot more than I thought I knew to make this happen.
<i>It seems writing about things forces you to understand them better!</i>
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, I'm going to keep writing about Arabic since it seems fun and I'd like to have a way to quickly review my notes
on what I'm learning.

<p>
Perhaps the most accessible book I've seen on Arabic grammar.
</p>

<p>
It's a small book, whose chapters are also small/focused and digestible.
</p>

<p>
It assumes you're familiar with the Arabic alphabet and takes you to forming
full sentences, and reading short stories.

KEYBOARD LAYOUT
---------------
This input method works by translating individual input characters.
Assuming that your actual keyboard has the ‘standard’ layout,
translation results in the following "virtual" keyboard layout
(the labels on the keys indicate what character will be produced
by each key, with and without holding Shift):

     +----------------------------------------------------------+
      | ۱ ! | ۲ ْ | ۳ ً | ۴ ٰ | ۵ ٪ | ۶ َ | ۷ &amp; | ۸ * | ۹ ( | ۰ ) | − ـ‎ | = + | ٔ ّ |
     +----------------------------------------------------------+
        | غ‎ ق‎ | ع‎ ء‎ | ِ ٍ | ر‎ R | ت‎ ط‎ | ی‎ ي‎ | و‎ ٓ | ی‎ ئ‎ | ُ ٌ | پ‎ P | [ { | ] } |
       +---------------------------------------------------------+
         | ا‎ آ‎ | س‎ ص‎| د‎ ٱ‎ | ف‎ إ‎ | گ‎ غ‎ | ه‎ ح‎ | ج‎ ‍ | ک‎ ك‎ | ل‎ L | ؛‎ : | ' " | \ | |

KEY SEQUENCE

You can also input more characters by the following key sequences:

<a href="https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-115.game">TypingClub ~ Arabic</a> is a fun &amp; free website to learn how to type Arabic on a standard keyboard. I highly recommend it.

<p>
Being able to type Arabic while <i>thinking</i> in Arabic, instead of thinking of sounds using the English alphabet to approximate
Arabic sounds, may be helpful in actually learning Arabic.

I found some images online, from <a href="http://oerabic.llc.ed.ac.uk/?p=2756">OERabic​</a>, that I thought could be used to enhance my prose.

It makes use of (an implicit argument) ‘o-label’.<br>&emsp; Be aware that ‘o-label’ is a string that may contain spaces; e.g., when the action is to open<br>&emsp; a URL in a browser.<br><br>&emsp; If you are in need of providing similar, related, actions on a single link<br>&emsp; then your :follow can condition on the current prefix argument via ‘o-prefix’<br>&emsp; (which is essentially ‘current-prefix-arg’).<br>&emsp; For instance, a user presses “C-u RET” on your link to do one thing<br>&emsp; but “C-u 72 RET” to do another action.<br><br>+ :keymap is an alternating list of keys and actions to be<br>&emsp;performed when those keys are pressed while point is on the link.<br>&emsp;For example:<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;[:keymap (C-h (message-box ''hola''))]<br><br>&emsp;By default, C-n and C-p are for moving to next and previous occruances of the same link type.<br><br>+ :let is a list of alternating variable symbol name and value, which are then used to form<br>&emsp;a concrete ‘let*’ clause. This is useful for introducing local variables for use in the DISPLAY<br>&emsp;as well as in the CONTENTS. Such local declarations may make use of O-LABEL and O-DESCRIPTION, as usual.<br><br>(fn NAME &optional DOCSTRING DISPLAY &rest BODY)">org-deflink</abbr> has nice examples, so we quickly adapt the very first example for our needs: We look at
the label given to the link, then depending on that, we show an clickable image along with a tooltip.

It is important for consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, such as بَابْ “bab” which means <em>door.</em><br><br>Incidentally, when a sound needs to be repeated twice, it is usually written once with a <em>Shadda</em> ـّـ to indicate the<br>doubling.&emsp;For example, فَهِمَ <em>fahima</em> “he understood” but فَهَّمَ <em>fahhama</em> “he explained”. Shadda is used with الـ + ‘sun<br>letters’. Unlike the other short vowels, the Shadda is usually written even in informal Arabic, to avoid ambiguity.<br><br><br>Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters <em>after</em> the short vowels:<br> | Long vowel&emsp;sound | Arabic | English example |<br> | <em>aa</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| ـَا&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| <em>far</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; |<br> | <em>ii</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| ـِي&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| <em>meet</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|<br> | <em>uu</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| ـُو&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;| <em>boot</em>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;|<br><br>Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels <em>aa,ii,uu</em> (when<br>preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds <em>a,y,w</em>.<br> + For example, as a consonant, ي (https://arabic.fi/letters/74) makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.<br> + Occasionally, <em>aa</em> is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots), or یٰ, rather than an<br>&emsp; <em>alif</em>. This always happens at the end of a word and is called <em>alif maqsuura</em><br>&emsp; “broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسیٰ “Musa”.<br><br>The following video reads all Arabic letters, where each letter is vowelised by one of the 3 short vowels.

Arabs <i>infer</i> vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ
“he was carried”.

<p>
The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using
sukkun, هْهْهْهْ. It is important for consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, such as بَابْ “bab” which means <i>door.</i>
</p>

<p>
Incidentally, when a sound needs to be repeated twice, it is usually written once with a <i>Shadda</i> ـّـ to indicate the
doubling.  For example, فَهِمَ <i>fahima</i> “he understood” but فَهَّمَ <i>fahhama</i> “he explained”. Shadda is used with الـ + ‘sun
letters’. Unlike the other short vowels, the Shadda is usually written even in informal Arabic, to avoid ambiguity.
</p>


<p>
Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters <i>after</i> the short vowels:

<p>
Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels <i>aa,ii,uu</i> (when
preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds <i>a,y,w</i>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For example, as a consonant, <a href="https://arabic.fi/letters/74">ي</a> makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.</li>
<li>Occasionally, <i>aa</i> is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots), or یٰ, rather than an
<i>alif</i>. This always happens at the end of a word and is called <i>alif maqsuura</i>
“broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسیٰ “Musa”.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following video reads all Arabic letters, where each letter is vowelised by one of the 3 short vowels. It's a really
nice video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1Cl6W8EEBQ?start=6">https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1Cl6W8EEBQ?start=6</a>.

&lt;hr&gt; In Arabic, <i>possessive and object pronouns</i> are <i>attached pronouns</i>; they are <b>joined to the end</b> of a word: For example,
<i>house</i> بیت becomes <i>my house</i> بیتِي, and from <i>he helped</i> نَصَرَ we get نَصَرَني <i>he helped me</i>.
Arabic's object &amp; possessive pronouns are the same, except for the “my/me” case.

<div style="padding: 1em;background-color: #CCFFCC;border-radius: 15px;font-size: 0.9em;"> <h3>transitive</h3>
<p>
A “transitive” verb is a verb that requires an object to express a complete thought, otherwise it is “intransitive”.
Some verbs are both transitive and intransitive.
</p>

<p>
A “transitive” verb needs to <i>transfer its action</i> to something or someone &#x2014;the object.
In essence, transitive means “to affect something else.”
</p>

<p>
For example, “Please bring coffee.” would not be a complete thought without the object “coffee”.
That is, “Please bring.” is an incomplete thought: What or whom should we bring? As such, “bring” is a transitive verb.
In contrast, “Please sing.” is a complete thought, and so “sing” is an intransitive verb &#x2014;actually, it's also transitive.
</p>

<p>
In Arabic, the Form-4 أفْعَلَ pattern turns intransitive verbs into transitive ones; and turns transitive verbs into
doubly-transitive verbs &#x2014;which means it takes two objects: E.g., “I gave the boy the ball”, here “gave” is
doubly-transitive. E.g., in Form-4, ر−س−ل “to send” gives the transitive verb أرْسَلَ which means it can be followed by two
objects: أرْسَلَ الولد لكتاب “The boy sent the book”.

VSCode evaluates Java code wherever it sees it, by sending it to a JShell in the background, and echos the results in a
friendly way!
</p>

<p>
This is achieved with a <a href="https://github.com/alhassy/easy-extensibility">meta-extension for VSCode</a> that makes VSCode into a living, breathing, JS interpreter: It can
execute arbitrary JS that alters VSCode on-the-fly.  <i>(Inspired by using Emacs and Lisp!)</i>

realistic for small experimentation &#x2014;after all, you're in a constrained environment and don't generally have the same

<p>
Let's explore Lisp's fine-grained type hierarchy!
</p>

<p>
We begin with a shallow comparison to Haskell, a rapid tour of type theory,
try in vain to defend dynamic approaches, give a somewhat humorous account of history,
note that you've been bamboozled &#x2014;type's have always been there&#x2014;,
then go into technical details of some Lisp types, and finally conclude by showing
how <i>macros permit typing</i>.
</p>

<p>
Goals for this article:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Multiple examples of type constructions in Lisp.</li>
<li>Comparing Lisp type systems with modern languages, such as Haskell.</li>
<li>Show how algebraic <a href="#orged0cebc">polymorphic</a> types like <code>Pair</code> and <code>Maybe</code> can be defined in Lisp.
Including heterogeneously typed lists!</li>
<li>Convey a passion for an elegant language.</li>
<li>Augment Lisp with functional Haskell-like type declarations ;-)</li>
</ol>

<p>
Unless suggested otherwise, the phrase “Lisp” refers to
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#index-cl_002ddeftype-14">Common Lisp as supported by Emacs Lisp</a>. As such, the resulting discussion
is applicable to a number of Lisp dialects
&#x2014;I'm ignoring editing types such as buffers and keymaps, for now.

I have convinced a number of my peers to use Emacs/Spacemacs/Doom-emacs,
but my efforts to get them to even consider trying Lisp have been met with
staunch rejection. These peers are familiar with Haskell, and almost all know Agda,
so you'd think they'd be willing to try Lisp &#x2014;it's there, part of their editor&#x2014;
but the superficial chasm in terms of syntax and types is more than enough apparently.
In this article, I aim to explore the type system of (Emacs) Lisp and occasionally
make comparisons to Haskell. Perhaps in the end some of my Haskell peers would be
willing to try it out.

It may not be entirely accurate to say that
Lisp's type system is more expressive than Haskell's
as it's orthogonal in many respects; although it is closer to that of <a href="https://liquid.kosmikus.org/01-intro.html#/what-is-liquid-haskell">Liquid Haskell</a>.

<i>Types allow us to treat objects according a similar structure
or interface.</i>
Unlike Haskell and other statically typed systems, in Lisp we have
that types can overlap.
As such, here's our working definition.
</p>
<div class="org-center">
<p>
A <b>type</b> is a collection of possible objects.
</p>

<p>
To say “\(e\) has type \(τ\)” one writes \(e : τ\), or in Lisp: <code>(typep e 'τ)</code>.

<p>
Haskellers and others may append to this definition the following,
which we will not bother with:
<i>Type membership is determined by inspecting

<p>
Strongly typed languages like Haskell allow only a number of the type formers listed
above. For example, Haskell does not allow unions but instead offers so-called sum
types. Moreover, unlike Haskell, Lisp is non-parametric:
We may pick a branch of computation according to the type of a value.
Such case analysis is available in languages such as C# &#x2014;c.f.,
<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2010/09/16/is-is-as-or-is-as-is/">is is as or is as is</a>. Finally, it is important to realise that <code>cons</code> is a monomorphic
type
&#x2014;it just means an (arbitrary) element consisting of two parts called <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code>&#x2014;
we show how to form a <a href="#orged0cebc">polymorphic</a> product type below.
</p>

<p>
We may ask for <i>the</i> ‘primitive type’ of an object;
which is the simplest built-in type that it belongs to,
such as integer, string, cons, symbol, record, subr, and a few others.
As such, <i>Lisp objects come with an intrinsic primitive type</i>;
e.g., <code>'(1 "2" 'three)</code> is a list and can only be treated as a value of
another type if an explicit coercion is used.
In Lisp, rather than variables, it is values that are associated with a type.
One may optionally declare the types of variables, like in OCaml.

<p>
In some sense, dynamic languages make it easy to produce <a href="#orged0cebc">polymorphic</a> functions.
Ironically, the previous sentences is only meaningful if you acknowledge the importance
of types and type variables.
</p>

<p>
In Lisp, types are inferred and needn't be declared.
However, the declaration serves as a nice documentation to further readers ;-)

<p>
Types are the central organising principle of the theory of programming languages.
Language features are manifestations of type structure.
The syntax of a language is governed by the constructs that define its types, and
its semantics is determined by the interactions among those constructs.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014; Robert Harper, Practical Foundations for Programming Languages

<p>
Besides atoms like numbers and strings,
the only way to form new terms in Lisp is using “modus ponens”,
or “function application”. Here's a first approximation:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-math">f : τ₁ → ⋯ → τₙ → τ   e₁ : τ₁  …  eₙ : τₙ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
           (f e₁ … eₙ) : τ
</pre>
</div>
<p>
One reads such a fraction as follows: If each part of the numerator &#x2014;the ‘hypothesises’&#x2014; is true, then so is the denominator &#x2014;the ‘conclusion’.
</p>

<p>
An <i>abstract syntax tree</i>, or ‘AST’, is a tree with operators for branches
and arguments for children. A tree is of kind τ if the topmost branching operator has τ as its resulting type. Here's an improved rule:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-math">f : τ₁ → ⋯ → τₙ → τ   e₁ : AST τ₁  …  eₙ : AST τₙ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              (f e₁ … eₙ) : AST τ
</pre>
</div>

<p>
A Lisp top-level then may execute or interpret such a form to obtain a value:
When we write <code>e</code> at a top-level, it is essentially <code>(eval e)</code> that is invoked.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-math">   e : AST τ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (eval e) : τ
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, we may also protect against evaluation.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-math">     e : AST τ
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  (quote e) : AST τ
</pre>
</div>

<p>
We have the following execution rules, where ‘⟿’ denotes “reduces to”.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-math">(eval a)         ⟿ a                        ;; for atom ‘a’
(eval (quote e))   ⟿ e
(eval (f e₁ … eₙ)) ⟿ (f (eval e₁) ⋯ (eval eₙ)) ;; Actually invoke ‘f’

Sometimes a value can be one of several types.
This is specified using union types; nested unions are essentially flattened

<blockquote>
<p>
Types are not objects in Common Lisp. There is no object that corresponds to the type
<code>integer</code>, for example. What we get from a function like <code>type-of</code>, and give as an argument
to a function like <code>typep</code>, is not a type, but a type specifier.
A type specifier is the name of a type. &#x2014;Paul Graham, ANSI Common Lisp
</p>

<p>
Type specifiers are essentially transformed into predicates as follows.

<h3 id="deftype"><span class="section-number-3">2.8</span> Making New Types with <code>deftype</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-deftype">
<p>
If we use a type specifier often, we may wish to abbreviate it using
the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#index-cl_002ddeftype-14">deftype</a> macro &#x2014;it is like <code>defmacro</code> but expands into a type specifier
instead of an expression.
</p>

<p>
We can define new types that will then work with <code>typecase</code> and friends
as follows:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Define a predicate <code>my-type-p</code>.</li>
<li>Test it out to ensure only the elements you want satisfy it.</li>
<li><p>
Register it using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html#index-cl_002ddeftype-14">deftype</a>.
</p>

<p>
You could just do number 3 directly, but it's useful to have the
predicate form of a <a href="#org9adf3f1">type descriptor</a>.
</p></li>

Notice that by the last example we can <b>control the degree of heterogeneity</b> in our lists!
So cool!
</p>

<p>
Here's some more exercises. The first should be nearly trivial, the second a bit more
work, and the last two have made me #sad.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Define a type <code>(rose τ)</code> whose elements are either τ values or rose trees of type τ.</li>

<li>Define a type <code>record</code> so that <code>(record τ₁ … τₙ)</code> denotes a record type whose iᵗʰ
component has type <code>τᵢ</code>.</li>

<li><p>
Define a type constructor <code>∃</code> such that, for example, <code>(∃ τ (pair integer τ)</code>
denotes the type of pairs where the first components are integers and the second
components all have the same type <code>τ</code>, but we do not know which one.
</p>

<p>
My idea was to let <code>τ</code> denote the type of the first occurrence of a value
at that location, then all subsequent checks now refer to this value of <code>τ</code>.
</p>

<p>
Sadly, I could not define this type :'(
</p>

<p>
Upon further reading, this may be doable using a <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Watching-Variables.html#Watching-Variables">variable watcher</a>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Produce a record for monoids and keep-track of the monoid instances produced.
Define a the predicate <code>(monoid τ)</code> to check if any of the monoid instances
has <code>τ</code> as its carrier type. In this way we could simulate Haskell typeclasses.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Let me know if you do cool things!

If we view a constructor declaration <code>C a₁ … aₙ</code> with superfluous parenthesis
as <code>(C a₁ … aₙ)</code>, then a translation to Lisp immediately suggests itself:
</p>
<div class="org-center">
<p>
<i>Haskell constructors ≅ Lisp lists whose <code>car</code> are constructor names</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
A nearly direct translation follows.

<p>
There are of-course much better ways to do this in Lisp; e.g.,
use <code>identity, +, -</code> in-place of the <code>var, add, neg</code> tags
to produce “syntax that carries its semantics”
or express the interpreter <code>int</code> as a one liner
by replacing the formal tags with their interpretations then
invoking Lisps <code>eval</code>. I doubt either of these are new ideas,
but the merit of the former seems neat &#x2014;at a first glance, at least.
</p>

<p>
Support for ADTs in Common Lisp along with seemingly less clunky pattern matching
can be found <a href="https://github.com/stylewarning/cl-algebraic-data-type">here</a> &#x2014;which I have only briefly looked at.
</p>

<p>
The Haskell presentation has type-checking baked into it, yet our
Lisp interpreter <code>int</code> does not! This seems terribly worrying, but
that <a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> declaration actually handles type checking for us!

<h2 id="why-dynamic"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> In Defence of Being Dynamically Checked</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-why-dynamic">
<div class="org-center">
<p>
<i>Lisp gets a bad rap for being untyped; let's clarify this issue further!</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
It is important to realise that nearly every language is typed &#x2014;albeit the checking
may happen at different stages&#x2014; and so, as <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/index.html">Benjamin Pierce</a> says:
<i>Terms like “dynamically typed” are arguably misnomers and should probably be replaced by “dynamically checked,” but the usage is standard.</i>
</p>

<p>
In particular, dynamically typed is <i>not</i> synonymous with untyped, though some people use
it that way since nearly <a href="https://www.williamjbowman.com/blog/2018/01/19/untyped-programs-don-t-exist/#related">every language is typed</a> &#x2014;possibly with a single anonymous
type.
</p>

<p>
Some people in the Haskell community, which I love, say things like
<i>“if it typechecks, ship it”</i> which is true more often than not, but it leads some
people to avoid producing unit tests. For example, the following type checks but
should be unit tested.
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #b58900;">mcbride</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">::</span> [<span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">Int</span>] <span style="color: #268bd2;">-&gt;</span> <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">Int</span>
<span style="color: #b58900;">mcbride</span> xs <span style="color: #268bd2;">=</span> <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">if</span> null xs <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">then</span> head xs <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">else</span> 666
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Regardless, I love static type checking and static analysis in general.
However, the shift to a dynamically checked setting has resulted in greater
interest in unit testing. For example, Haskell's solution to effectful computation
is delimited by types, as any Haskeller will proudly say (myself included);
but ask how are such computations unit tested and the room is
silent (myself included).
</p>

<p>
Interestingly some unit tests check the typing of inputs and output, which is
a mechanical process with no unknowns and so it should be possible to produce a syntax
for it using Lisp macros. This is one of the goals of this article and we'll return to
it later.
</p>

<p>
Even though I like Lisp, I'm not sure why dynamic typing is the way to go
&#x2014;c.f. <a href="https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/dynamic-languages-are-static-languages/">Dynamic Languages are Static Languages</a> which mentions the unjust tyranny of
unityped systems.
Below are two reasons why people may dislike static types.
</p>

<p>
<b>First</b>: The de-facto typing rule do binary choice is usually:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-math">     T : 𝔹     E : α     B : α -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     if T then E else B : α
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That means valid programs such as <code>if True then 1 else "two"</code> are rejected;
even though the resulting type will always be an integer there is no way to know
that statically &#x2014;the choice needs to be rewritten, evaluated at run time.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in Haskell, we would write
<code>if True then Left 1 else Right "two"</code> which has type <code>Either Int String</code>,
and to use the resulting value means we need to pattern match or use
the eliminator <code>(|||</code>) &#x2014;from Haskell's <code>Control.Arrow</code>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Second:</b>
Some statically typed languages have super weak type systems and ruin the rep
for everyone else.
For example, <code>C</code> is great and we all love it of-course, but it's a shame that we can only
express the <a href="#orged0cebc">polymorphic</a> identity function \(id : ∀{α}. α → α \;=\; λ x → x\),
by using the C-preprocessor &#x2014;or dismiss the types by casting pointers around.
</p>

<p>
Maybe this video is helpful, maybe not:
<a href="https://games.greggman.com/game/dynamic-typing-static-typing/">The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Dynamic Typing for Practical Programs</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
( For the algebraist: Dynamic typing is like working in a monoid whose
composition operation is partial and may abruptly crash; whereas static typing
is working in a category whose composition is proudly typed. )
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Overall I haven't presented a good defence for being dynamically checked, but you
should ignore my blunder and consider trying Lisp yourself to see how awesome it is.

<div id="outline-container-orgbe67c8a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="lisp-funny-history"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> With its hierarchy of types, why isn't Lisp statically typed?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-lisp-funny-history">
<div class="org-center">
<p>
<i>I haven't a clue. Here are two conjectures.</i>
</p>
</div>

<p>
<b>First</b>: Code that manipulates code is difficult to type.
</p>

<p>
Is the type of <code>'(+ x 2)</code> a numeric code expression?
Or just an arbitrary code expression? Am I allowed to “look inside”
to inspect its structure or is it a black box? What about the nature of
its constituents? If I'm allowed to look at them, can I ask if they're even defined?
</p>

<p>
What if <code>c</code> is a code element that introduces an identifier, say <code>it</code>.
What is type of <code>c</code>? What if it doesn't introduce and thus avoids accidentally
capturing identifiers? Are we allowed only one form or both? Which do we select
and why?
</p>

<p>
I may be completely wrong, but below I mention a <a href="#orgd4b9b6a">bunch of papers</a> that suggest
it's kind hard to type this stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Second</b>: The type theory just wasn't in place at the time Lisp was created.
</p>

Here's a probably wrong account of how it went down.

Such annotations mostly serve as compiler optimisation annotations and,
unfortunately, Emacs Lisp <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/Declarations.html">silently ignores Common Lisp declarations such as ftype</a>
&#x2014;which provides <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/lw51/CLHS/Body/d_ftype.htm#ftype">function type</a> declarations.
However,
Emacs Lisp does provide a method of <a href="http://www.p-cos.net/documents/filtered-dispatch.pdf">dispatch</a> filtered by <a href="http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/object-reorientation-generic-functions.html">classes</a> rather than by
simple types. Interestingly, Lisp methods are more like Haskell typeclass constituents
or C# extensible methods
rather than like Java object methods &#x2014;in that, <i>Lisp methods specialise on classes</i>

  member of that type. Usually, these are the type name appended with <code>-p</code>, for multi-word
  names, and <code>p</code> for single word names. E.g., <code>string</code> type has the predicate <code>stringp</code>.

They may also take <i>inclusive</i> (and exclusive) ranges:
The type list <code>(integer LOW HIGH)</code> represents all integers between
 <code>LOW</code> and <code>HIGH</code>, inclusive.  Either bound may be a list of a single
 integer to specify an exclusive limit, or a <code>*</code> to specify no
 limit.  The type <code>(integer * *)</code> is thus equivalent to <code>integer</code>.
 Likewise, lists beginning with <code>float</code>, <code>real</code>, or <code>number</code>
 represent numbers of that type falling in a particular range.

<p>
A character is just a small integers, up to 22 bits;
e.g., character <code>A</code> is represented as the integer 65.
</p>

<p>
One writes the character ‘A’ as <code>?A</code>, which is identical to 65.
Punctuations <code>()[]\;"|'`#</code> must be &#x00ad;escaped; e.g.,

<p>
Emacs specfic characters control-g <code>C-g</code>, backspace <code>C-h</code>, tab <code>C-i</code>, newline <code>C-j</code>, space,
return, del, and escape are expressed by ?\a, ?\b, ?\t, ?\n, ?\s, ?\r, ?\d, ?\e.
</p>

<p>
Generally, control characters can be expressed as <code>?\^𝓍 ≈ ?\C-𝓍</code>,
and meta characters by <code>?\M-𝓍</code>; e.g., <code>C-M-b</code> is expressed
<code>?\M-\C-b ≈ ?\C-\M-b</code>.
</p>

<p>
Finally, <code>?\S-𝓍</code> denotes shifted-𝓍 characters.
There are also <code>?\H-𝓍, ?\A-𝓍, ?\s-𝓍</code> to denote Hyper- Alt- or Super-modified keys;
note that lower case ‘s’ is for super whereas capital is for shift,
and lower case with no dash is a space character.

It may help to know that a <code>defun</code> just produces an alias for a function:

<p>
Like functions, any list that begins with <code>macro</code>, and whose <code>cdr</code>

<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
Since <code>defmacro</code> produces an alias, as follows,
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
You may be concerned that <code>(macrop x) ≟ (equal 'macro (car x))</code>, and so if a user
gives you a macro you might think its a cons cell of data.

Why not? Well, you could think of a macro as a ‘record’ whose label is <code>macro</code> and
its only element is the associated function.

<p>
Checking the type of inputs is tedious and so I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/cct5hp/functional_type_declarations_in_elisp/">guessed</a> it could be done using
macros and advice. Looking at <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/types.html">Typed Racket</a> for inspiration, the following
fictitious syntax would add advice to <code>f</code> that checks the optional arguments <code>xᵢ</code>
have type <code>σᵢ</code> and the mandatory positional arguments have type <code>τᵢ</code> according
to position, and the result of the computation is of type <code>τ</code>.
To the best of my knowledge, no one had done this for Emacs Lisp &#x2014;I don't know why.

To modify a variable, or function, we may simply redefine it; but a much more elegant and powerful
approach is to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Advising-Functions.html">“advise”</a> the current entity with some new behaviour. In our case of interest, we will
<i>advise functions to check their arguments before executing their bodies</i>.
</p>

<p>
Below is my attempt: <a id="org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a>. Before you get scared or think it's horrendous, be charitable and
note that about a third of the following is documentation and a third is local declarations.

<span style="color: #35a69c; font-style: italic;">   Using type specifiers we accommodate for unions of types</span>

<p>
There are some notable shortcomings: Lack of support for type variables and, for now, no support for
optional arguments. Nonetheless, I like it &#x2014;of course.
( Using <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Watching-Variables.html#Watching-Variables">variable watchers</a> we could likely add support for type variables as well as
function-types. )

<p>
As it currently stands we cannot make any explicit references between the inputs
and the output, but that's an easy fix: Simply add a local function <code>old</code> to the
<a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> macro which is intentionally exposed so that it can be used in the
type declarations to refer to the ‘old’, or initial, values provided to the function.
Additionally, one could also add keyword arguments <code>:requires</code> and <code>:ensures</code>
for a more sophisticated pre- and post-condition framework.
<a href="https://github.com/sellout/quid-pro-quo">Something</a> along these lines is implemented for Common Lisp.
</p>

<p>
Here's a fun exercise: Recast the <a href="https://liquid.kosmikus.org/01-intro.html#/what-is-liquid-haskell">Liquid Haskell</a> examples in Lisp using this
<a href="#org84d2c90"><code>declare-type</code></a> form.

Herein I try to make my current doctoral research accessible to the average person:
Extending dependently-typed languages to implement module system features in the core
language. It's something I can direct my family to, if they're inclined to know what it is
I've been doing lately.
</p>

<p>
The technical matter can be seen at the associated website
─<a href="https://alhassy.github.io/next-700-module-systems-proposal/">The Next 700 Module Systems</a>─ which includes a poster, slides, and a demo.
</p>

<p>
Excluding the abstract, this is my thesis proposal in <i>three minutes</i> (•̀ᴗ•́)و

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Have you ever been confused by packages?</li>

<li><p>
There are so many parts when it comes to packaging:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>There's the stamps,</li>
<li>the addresses,</li>
<li>the contents,</li>
<li>the damage insurance,</li>
<li>the package weight,</li>
<li>customs declarations!</li>
</ol>

<p>
There's so many parts!
</p></li>

<li>Look at them! ⟪ gesture to screen ⟫
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There's so many! The place is a mess!</li>
<li>This could be you parents' basement!</li>
<li>It could be your work desk!</li>
<li>In computing, this is your code! Mish-mashed from smaller pieces!</li>
<li>Eek!</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Unlike the day-to-day mail we receive, in computing, packages take the form of modules
and each of these separate, yet crucial, aspect of packaging corresponds to a different
<i>language</i>! ⟪Pause⟫</li>

<li><p>
Think about it: On average, a ‘coding language’ actually consists of at least 4 different
languages! That's like if your package in the mail had
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a stamp in English,</li>
<li>an address in Spanish,</li>
<li>contents in Latin,</li>
<li>the insurance policy in German,</li>
<li>package weight in Gaelic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What a headache!
</p></li>

<li>You shouldn't have to go to college to understand how your mail works!</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1c5096c" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1c5096c"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Part II ─Building blocks</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just as a clingy boyfriend, or a puppy that follows you around, is called a ‘dependent type’
we have those in computing too and they're essentially the same thing!

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Software that uses dependent types lets us treat the different pieces
as if they were the same &#x2013;except packages, they still live in their own language.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Packages are a building block of computing, like Lego(!):
You can build better, compact,
software using pre-built blocks. ⟪ Gesture hands together. ⟫</li>

<li>Since computing is so young as a science,
we don't really know how pieces should be glued together.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You'd think otherwise since you have a brick in your pocket
that can access all knowledge of humanity.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>For the most part, we cope by ad hoc methods &#x2013; “it works good enough”.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Unfortunately this does not scale!</li>
<li>⟪wave at slide⟫ package maintenance can get out of hand
rather quickly for any large piece of software!</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga8c2f25" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga8c2f25"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Part III ─Arithmetic</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Just as the clingy boyfriend and the puppy dog that follows you around can be seen as just
more family; with dependent types, packages too can be treated as just normal blocks.</li>

<li><p>
I'm researching the arithmetic of packages
to help software developers manage large projects and reduce complexity &amp; maintenance costs.
</p>

<p>
My research suggests that packaging can be treated in the same way we
treat numbers.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We can combine numbers by adding them, likewise we can combine packages by
putting their pieces together in a new package!</li>

<li>In grade school, “2 + 3 and 3 + 2 are both 5”,
yet with packages “2 + 3 might be 5, but 3 + 2 might not even exist!”</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
So next time you send a package, think of what it means to me and how many
languages are involved!

Do you know what the above program accomplishes?
If you do, did you also spot a special edge case?
</p>

<p>
We aim to present an approach to program proving in C using a minimal Emacs setup
so that one may produce literate C programs and be able to prove them correct
&#x2013;or execute them&#x2013; using a single button press; moreover the output is again in Emacs.
</p>

<p>
The goal is to learn program proving using the Frama-C tool
&#x2013;without necessarily invoking its gui&#x2013; by loading the source of this file into
Emacs then editing, executing, &amp; proving as you read along.
One provides for the formal specification of properties of C programs &#x2013;e.g., using ACSL&#x2013;
 which can then be verified for the implementations using tools that interpret such annotation
&#x2013;e.g., Frama-C invoked from within our Emacs setup.
</p>

<p>
Read on, and perhaps you'll figure out how to solve the missing <code>FixMe</code> pieces 😉
</p>

<p>
The intent is for rapid editing and checking.
Indeed, the Frama-c gui does not permit editing in the gui, so one must switch between
their text editor and the gui.
<a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org4beginners.html">Org mode beginning at the basics</a> is a brief tutorial that covers a lot of Org and,
from the get-go, covers “the absolute minimum you need to know about Emacs!”
</p>

<p>
If anything, this effort can be construed as a gateway into interactive theorem proving
such as with Isabelle, Coq, or Agda.
</p>

<p>
The article <i>aims</i> to be self-contained &#x2013;not even assuming familiarity with any C!

There are no solutions since it's too easy to give up and look at the solutions that're
nearby. Moreover, I intend to use some of the exercises for a class I'm teaching ;-)

<p>
Despite its age, C is a widely used language and so is available on many platforms.
Moreover, many systems rely on code historically written in C that needs to be maintained.
</p>

<p>
The traditional way to obtain confidence that a program correctly works is to provide
inputs we believe to be representative of the actual use of the program and
verify the results we get are correct. Incidentally, the unexpected cases are often not
considered whereas they are generally the most dangerous ones.
Since we cannot test everything, we need to employ great care in selecting good tests.
</p>

<p>
Since it is hard to answer “Is our software tested enough?”, we consider mathematically
proving that there cannot be problems at runtime. That is, a specification of the expected
behaviour is provided, which is satisfied by the <i>resulting</i> program
&#x2013;note the order: Specify <i>then obtain</i> code! This two-stage process can produce errors
in either stage, yet whereas testing ensures “the program avoids the bugs we tested against”
this approach is a big step ensuring “the program doesn't contain bugs that don't exist in
the specification.”
</p>

<p>
The goal here is to use a tool to learn the basics of C program proof
&#x2013;Frama-C: FRAmework for Modular Analysis of C code.
In particular, to demonstrate the ability to write programs without any error
by emphasising the simple notions needed to write programs more confidently.
</p>

<p>
Testing is ‘dynamic analysis’ since it requires the actual execution of programs,
whereas our program proof approach is ‘static’ since no execution is performed but instead
we reason on a semantic model of the reachable states.
The semantics associated with the C language control structures and statements we will
use is known as Hoare Logic. One writes a “Hoare Triple” <i>{G} S {R}</i> to express that
“Starting in a given state (satisfying) <i>G</i>, the execution of <i>S</i> terminates such that the
resulting state (satisfies) R”.
</p>

<p>
How does one <i>prove</i> such a triple? Programs are constructed from a variety of pieces,
so it suffices to look at each of those. That is, <i>{G} S {R}</i> has the code <i>S</i> transform
the required predicate <i>R</i> to the given <i>G</i> &#x2013;since we usually know what is required
and it is the goal of the program. In general, we find the <i>weakest</i> precondition that
works since then it allows the largest possible number of inputs;
if <i>G</i> is at least as strong as the weakest precondition, then our program is correct but
may allow less then the largest amount of possible inputs.
</p>

<p>
For example, <i>{5 ≤ x ≤ 10} x ≔ x + 1 { 3 ≤ x ≤ 11}</i> is a correct program that ends in state
<i>3 ≤ x ≤ 11</i>, however its precondition could be weakened to <i>2 ≤ x ≤ 10</i> thereby allowing
many more  valid inputs.
</p>

<p>
In Frama-C, we do not use curly braces like this for such assertions but instead
express our properties as code annotations using the ANSI C Specification Language
&#x2013;ACSL or “axel”. The weakest precondition plugin uses the annotation and the code to
automatically ensure the program is correct according to the Hoare Logic fashion
mentioned earlier.

<p>
Which code blocks are currently under focus is controlled by the command
<code>(currently-working-with "nameHere")</code>, which produces a file <code>nameHere.c</code> that is used
for the utility functions. If multiple blocks use the same filename, then the file is
appended to.
While reading this tutorial, bring/take code blocks in/out of focus by
toggling between <code>(currently-working-with "nameHere")</code> and
<code>(not-currently-working-with "nameHere")</code> &#x2014;that is, simply prepend <code>not-</code>.
Remember to undo such a toggle when you're done with a code block.

When no name is provided to <code>[not-]currently-working-with</code>, the name of the buffer is used.

We can see that Frama-C proves these assertions by obtaining “green bullets”
beside them if we execute
</p>
<pre class="example">
frama-c-gui -wp -rte myfile.c
</pre>
<p>
Or check-boxes beside them if we instead execute
</p>
<pre class="example">
frama-c-gui -gui-theme colorblind -wp -rte myfile.c
</pre>
<p>
The best way to know which options are available is to use
</p>
<pre class="example">
frama-c -wp-help
</pre>

<p>
We will however use the special Emacs calls defined at the bottom of this file,
<code>frama-c</code> and <code>frama-c-no-gui</code>, to avoid having to switch between a terminal and a
text editor. Thank-you extensible editor Emacs ⌣̈ ♥
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Press <code>F8</code> to invoke the Frama-C gui.</li>
<li>Press <code>F9</code> to invoke Frama-C within Emacs and obtain status about the program proof.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you uncomment the IO matter, Frama-C may yield an error.
<b>Separate your IO into its own driver file!</b>
Invoke Frama-C only on programs you want to prove &#x2013;without any IO.
</p>

<p>
Go back to the above example, and change the first assertion in <code>main,
~a == 42</code>, to assert that <code>a</code> equals <code>432</code>. Now invoke <code>M-x framac-no-gui</code>, or press <code>F9</code>,
to obtain the message,
</p>
<pre class="example">
Frama-C: 90﹪ of proof complete!
</pre>
<p>
Moreover, another buffer will be open and in red will be highlighted,
</p>
<pre class="example">
[wp] [Alt-Ergo] Goal typed_main_assert_Before_Swap : Unknown (Qed:0.63ms) (57ms)
</pre>
<p>
This indicates that, in method <code>main</code>, the named assertion <code>Before_Swap</code> could not be proven.
</p>

<p>
Now revert all alterations and in the specification of <code>swap</code>, alter
<code>ensures *a ==== \old(*b);</code> to become <code>ensures *a == \old(*a);</code>, thereby expressing
that the value of <code>a</code> is unaltered by the program. Checking this yields a false
assertion! Neato.
</p>

<p>
As such, I suggest the following literate process:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Write your code in Org-mode code blocks,</li>
<li>Check it works with <code>frama-c-no-gui</code> (F9) or <code>frama-c</code> (F8).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we open the gui, we may right-click on a function name and select
<code>Prove function annotations by WP</code> to have our assertions checked.</li>
<li>Remember that the frama-c gui does not allow source code edition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Investigate output, then make changes in source file and re-check.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Observe
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Program proof is a way to ensure that our programs only have correct behaviours,
described by our specification;</li>
<li>It is still our work to ensure that this specification is correct.</li>

<p>
Recall that a Hoare Triple <i>{G} S {R}</i> expresses that if execution of program <code>S</code> is begun
in a state satisfying proposition <i>G</i> then it terminates in a state satisfying proposition <i>R</i>.
We usually know <i>R</i> &#x2013;it is the required behaviour on <code>S</code> after all&#x2013; but otherwise we usually
only have a vague idea of what <i>G</i> could possible be.
Dijkstra's <i>weakest precondition</i> operator ‘wp’ tells us how to <b>compute</b> <i>G</i> from <i>R</i>
&#x2013;in the process we usually <b>discover</b> <code>S</code>.
</p>

<p>
Hence, all in all, programming begins with the required goal from which code is then derived.
</p>

<details class="code-details"> <summary> <strong> <font face="Courier" size="3" color="green"> Details </font> </strong> </summary> <p>
Post-conditions <i>R</i> are expressed using the <code>ensures</code> clause, and dually pre-conditions <i>G</i>
are expressed using <code>requires</code> clauses. These <i>G</i> are properties assumed for the input
and it is the callers responsibility to ensure that they are true
&#x2013;recall that when a contract is breached, the implementation may behave arbitrarily.
</p>
 </details>

<p>
Since ‘wp’ is intended to <b>compute</b> the weakest precondition establishing a given
postcondition <i>R</i> for a statement <code>S</code>, it necessarily satisfies
</p>
<pre class="example">
    { G } S { R }   ≡   G ⇒ wp S R
</pre>

<p>
The left side may be rendered using ACSL,
</p>
<pre class="example">
// @ assert G;
S;
// @ assert R;
</pre>

<p>
The WP plugin for Frama-C essentially works by computing <code>wp S R</code> then attempts to obtain
a proof for <code>G ⇒ wp S R</code>.
In particular, by the reflexivity of implication, ‘wp’ guarantees to produce a
precondition so that the following Hoare triple is valid.
</p>
<pre class="example">
   { wp S R } S { R }
</pre>

<p>
Most programming languages have, among others, five constructs:
Assignment, variable declaration, sequence, test, and loop.
These constructs from the <i>imperative core</i> of the language.
Since programs are built using such primitive control structures, it suffices to define
wp “by induction” on the shape of <code>S</code>.
</p>

<p>
One reasonable property we impose on wp from the outset is: <br>
If <i>S</i> establishes <i>R</i> which implies <i>R′</i>, then <i>S</i> also establishes <i>R′</i>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
Monotonicity: R ⇒ R′   implies  wp S R ⇒ wp S R′
                       That is, {wp S R} S {R′}
</pre>
<p>
Whence for each definitional clause of wp, we must ensure this desirable property is held.
</p>

<details class="code-details"> <summary> <strong> <font face="Courier" size="3" color="green"> Details </font> </strong> </summary> <p>

</p>

<p>
Imperative programs alter state, as such a statement <code>S</code> is essentially a function
that transforms the memory state of the computer.
Expressing in English what happens when a statement is executed is possible
for simple examples, but such explanations quickly become complicated and imprecise.
Therefore, one introduces a theoretical framework reifying statements as state transformers.
</p>

<p>
The two popular notions are the “forwards” <code>⟦S⟧</code> moves current state to a new state,
whereas we are working with “backwards” <code>wp S</code> which takes a desired state and yields
a necessary previous state. The forward notion ‘executes’ a program by starting in
the empty state and stepping through each command to result in some final state.
Whereas the backwards notion takes an end goal and suggests which programming constructs
are needed to obtain it.
Hence, ‘forwards’ is verification whereas ‘backwards’ is correct-by-construction
programming.
</p>

<p>
Suppose there is an infinite set <code>Var</code> of variables and an infinite set <code>Val</code> of values,
which are integers, booleans, etc. In the ‘forwards’ notion, a <i>state</i> is a partial
function from variables to values &#x2013;`partial' since it may be undefined at some
variables, since we usually use only finitely many
in our programs anyways. E.g., state <code>{x ↦ 5, y ↦ 6}</code> associates the value 5 to variable <code>x</code>
but is undefined for variable <code>z</code>. Dually, in the ‘backwards’ notion, a <i>state</i> is a predicate of the
variables and their values that satisfy the predicate; e.g., the previous example state
corresponds to the predicate <code>x = 5 ∧ y = 6</code>, where <code>z</code> can have <i>any</i> value.
Hence the predicate formulation is more relaxed and we shall refer to it instead.

<div id="outline-container-org72726a6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org72726a6"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Assignment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<p>
The <i>assignment</i> construct allows the creation of a statement with a variable
<code>x</code> and an expression <code>E</code>. The assignment statement is written <code>x = E;</code>.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variables are identifiers which are written with one or more letters.</li>
<li>Expressions are composed of variables, constants, and operator calls.</li>
<li>Sometimes one <i>notates</i> assignment by <code>x ≔ E</code> even though it is invalid C code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To understand the execution of an assignment, suppose that within the
recesses of your computer's memory, there is a compartment labelled <code>x</code>.
Obtain the <i>value</i> of <code>E</code> &#x2013;possibly having to look up values of variables
that <code>E</code> mentions&#x2013; then erase the contents of <code>x</code> and fill the compartment
with the newly obtained value.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the contents of the computer's memory is called a <i>state</i>.
We also say “predicate <i>R</i> is the current state” as shorthand for:
The current state is (non-deterministically) <i>any</i> variable-value assignment
such that predicate <i>R</i> is true.
</p>

<p>
All in all, executing <code>x ≔ E</code> loads memory location <code>x</code> with the value of expression <code>E</code>;
hence state <i>R</i> is satisfied after an assignment precisely when it is satisfied
with variable <code>x</code> replaced by expression <code>E</code>. For example, <code>wp (x ≔ x+1) (x = 5)  ≡  (x+1 = 5)</code>.
</p>
<pre class="example">
wp (x ≔ E) R  ≡  R[x ≔ E]
</pre>

<p>
Before being able to assign values to a variable <code>x</code>, it must be <i>declared</i>,
which associates the name <code>x</code> to a location in the computer's memory.
<i>Variable declaration</i> is a construct that allows the creation of a statement
composed of a variable, an expression, and a statement. This is written
<code>{T x = e; p}</code>, then variable <code>x</code> can be used in statement <code>p</code>, which is called
the <i>scope</i> of variable <code>x</code>.
( When <code>p</code> has no assignments, functional programmers would call this statement
  a <i>let statement</i> since it lets <code>x</code> take on the value <code>e</code> in <code>p</code>. )

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
A <i>sequence</i> is a construct that allows a single statement to be created out of
two statements <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>; it is written <code>{p q}</code>.
The sequence is executed in state <code>s</code> by first executing <code>p</code> in state <code>s</code> thereby
producing a new state <code>s'</code> in which statement <code>q</code> is then executed.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The statement <code>{p₁ {p₂ { ... pₙ } ...}}</code> can also be written <code>{p₁ p₂ ... pₙ}</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Usually a ‘;’ symbol is used in favour of a space, with braces, to yield,
</p>
<pre class="example">
wp (S₁;S₂) R  ≡  wp S₁ (wp S₂ R)
</pre>
<p>
The pre-condition of the second statement becomes the post-condition of the first
statement. Hence, we “push” along the post-condition into a sequence:
In the upcoming swapping example, we read the proof steps from bottom to top!
</p>

<p>
Rendered pointfree, i.e., ignoring <i>R</i>, this rule becomes: <i>wp (S₁;S₂)  = wp S₁ ∘ wp S₂</i>.
</p>

<p>
Recall that we need to ensure monotonicity is satisfied, and indeed: If <i>R ⇒ R′</i>, then
</p>
<pre class="example">
  wp (S₁;S₂) R
≡ wp S₁ (wp S₂ R)    -- Definition of wp on sequence
⇒ wp S₁ (wp S₂ R′)   -- Monotoncity for Sᵢ, twice; with assumption R ⇒ R′
≡ wp (S₁;S₂) R      -- Definition of wp on sequence
</pre>
<p>
Neato!
</p>

<p>
Moreover, notice we have the useful ‘transitivity’ property for Hoare triples:
</p>
<pre class="example">
   {G} S₁ {R′}  ∧  {R′} S₂ {R}
≡  (G ⇒ wp S₁ R′)  ∧  (R′ ⇒ wp S₂ R)              -- Characterisation of wp
⇒ (G ⇒ wp S₁ R′)  ∧  (wp S₁ R′ ⇒ wp S₁ (wp S₂ R)) -- Monotonicity of wp
⇒ (G ⇒ wp S₁ (wp S₂ R))                           -- Transitivity of implication
≡  G ⇒ wp (S₁;S₂) R                               -- Definition of wp on sequence
≡  {G} S₁;S₂ {R}                                  -- Characterisation of wp
</pre>

<h3 id="org637ffa8"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Skip</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
The “empty sequence” is denoted <code>{}</code> or just <code>;</code> in the C language.
It is also commonly known as the <code>skip</code> construct and its importance is akin to that
of zero to addition.
</p>

<pre class="example">
wp skip R  ≡  R
</pre>
<p>
The “do nothing” program <code>skip</code> is rendered as simple <code>;</code> or as whitespace in the C language.
This program does not alter the state at all, thus it truthifies <i>R</i> precisely when <i>R</i>
was true to begin with.
</p>

<p>
Most often this appears in a weakening/strengthening form,
</p>
<pre class="example">
...code here...
//@ assert P;
//@ assert Q;
...code here...
</pre>
<p>
Where <i>P ⇒ Q</i> is provable.

<p>
Woah! It looks like the identity function somehow transforms input satisfying
<i>3 &lt; x &lt; 9</i> to input satisfying <i>-20 ≤ x ≤ 99</i>.
Wait, the former implies the latter and that's just the definition of <i>wp</i> on <code>skip</code>.
</p>

<p>
The above example suggests the following calculation,
</p>
<pre class="example">
   (G′ ⇒ G)  ∧  {G} S {R}  ∧  (R ⇒ R′)
≡  (G′ ⇒ G)  ∧  (G ⇒ wp S R)  ∧  (R ⇒ R′) -- Characterisation of wp
⇒ (G′ ⇒ wp S R)  ∧  (R ⇒ R′)              -- Transitivity of implication
⇒ (G′ ⇒ wp S R)  ∧  (wp S R ⇒ wp S R′)    -- Monotonicity of wp
⇒ (G′ ⇒ wp S R′)                          -- Transitivity of implication
≡  {G′} S {R′}                            -- Characterisation of wp
</pre>
<p>
That is, strengthening the precondition or weakening the post-condition leaves
a Hoare triple valid. In some industry circles &#x2013;e.g., C#&#x2013;, this is referred to as
contravariance (antitone) in the input and covariance (monotone) in the output.
</p>

<p>
For example, if <code>G′, G, R, R′</code> were classes such that <code>G′</code> is a subclass of <code>G</code>
and <code>R</code> is a subclass of <code>R′</code>, then the program <code>S</code> takes an input of type <code>G</code> yielding an
output of type <code>R′</code>. However, any input of type <code>G′</code> can be cast into the parent-class
type <code>G</code> and, likewise, <code>R</code> objects can be cast into the parent-type <code>R′</code>.
Thus, program <code>S</code> can also take the type of <code>G′</code> to <code>R′</code>.
</p>

<p>
Writing <code>&lt;:</code> for ‘sub-type’, or ‘sub-class’, we have argued,
</p>
<pre class="example">
Provided    G′ &lt;: G  and R &lt;: R′
Then
       G → R  &lt;:  G′ → R′
</pre>
<p>
It is now easier to see that the second argument of function-type former ‘→’ stays
on the same side of the <code>&lt;:</code> symbol, whereas it is flipped for the first argument.
</p>

<p>
Completely unrelated &#x2013;or not&#x2013; a nearly identical property holds for implication:
If <i>G′ ⇒ G</i> and <i>R ⇒ R′</i> then (G ⇒ R) ⇒ (G′ ⇒ R′). How coincidental &#x2026; or not!
\\ ( Foreshadowing: Curry-Howard Correspondence! )
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, this strengthening-weakening law will be useful when computing the <i>wp</i> of a
statement directly is difficult &#x2013;and possibly unhelpful&#x2013; but we have a stronger
precondition and so it suffices to use that.
( Foreshadowing: Loops! )
</p>

<p>
Before we close, here is an <b>exercise</b> to the reader: An alternate proof of the above law.
</p>
<pre class="example">
   (G′ ⇒ G)  ∧  {G} S {R}  ∧  (R ⇒ R′)
≡  {G′} skip {G} ∧ {G} S {R} ∧ {R} skip {R′}    -- ???
⇒ {G′} skip; S {R} ∧ {R} skip {R′}             -- ???
⇒ {G′} skip; S; skip {R′}                      -- ???
≡  {G′} S {R′}                                  -- skip is no-op &amp; can be removed.
</pre>

<p>
The last hint in the above calculation deserves some attention.

Where <code>skip</code> is the fictional statement that performs no action when executed.
</p>

<p>
To understand the semantics of the loop:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Let <code>giveup, terminate</code> be aliases for <code>abort</code> and <code>skip</code>.</li>
<li><p>
Recalling that a loop is a shorthand for an infinite nesting of conditionals,
we try to approach it as a limit of finite approximations.
</p>
<pre class="example">
     while (b) q  ≈  limₙ pₙ

  Where:
  p₀ = if (b) giveup else terminate
  p₁ = if (b) {q ; if b giveup else terminate} else terminate
  ⋯
  pₙ₊₁ = if (b) {q; pₙ} else terminate;
</pre></li>

<li>The statement <code>pₙ</code> tries to execute the statement <code>while (b) q</code> by completing
a maximum of <code>n</code> trips through the loop. If, after <code>n</code> loops, it has not
terminated on its own, it gives up.</li>

<li><p>
If the loop terminates in <i>m</i> trips, it also terminates in <i>n ≥ m</i> trips.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>∀ m. pₘ defined ⇒ ∀ n ≥ m. pₙ defined</i></li>
<li><i>∀ m. pₘ defined ⇒ ∀ n ≥ m. pₙ ≈ pₘ</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Where ‘defined’ means it terminates without aborting.
</p></li>
<li>Hence, by these two claims, we know that the sequence <i>pₙ</i> either never defined
or it is defined beyond a certain point, and in this case, it is constant over its domain.</li>
<li>Hence: <code>while(b) q ≈ limₙ pₙ</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The definition of ‘wp’ for loops is complicated and generally unhelpful, however
from it we can prove the so called “Invariance Theorem”:
If a property is maintained by the body of the loop
and there is an integral value expressed using the body's variables
that starts out non-negative and is decreased by each loop pass,
then the loop will terminate and the property it maintained will be true.
</p>

<pre class="example">
   {Inv ∧ B ∧ bf = c} S {Inv ∧ bf &lt; c}
⇒
   {Inv ∧ bf ≥ 0}  while(B) S  {¬B ∧ Inv}
</pre>
<p>
A property that is maintained to be true throughout the loop is referred to as an
<i>invariant</i>. In contrast, a value that changes through every pass
&#x2013;such as the number of passes remaining, the <code>bf</code>&#x2013; is known as a <i>variant</i>.
</p>

<p>
In Frama-C rendition,
</p>
<pre class="example">
/*@ loop invariant ⋯  // property that is maintained by the loop body
  @ loop assigns ⋯    // variables that are altered by the loop body
  @ loop variant ⋯    // a bound on the total number of loops
  */
while(B) S;
</pre>

<p>
Incidentally the primary function of the <code>assigns</code> clause is that variables its does
not mention essentially have the invariant property of being equal to their value
before the loop. That is, the <code>assigns</code> clause reduces clutter regarding constants
from the invariant!

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
Our invaraints were getting out of hand, the trouble can be mitigated by defining our own
predicates rather than just using the built in ones. However, such definitions must be
<i>functional</i> in nature: They do not produce side-effects, such as altering state.
Moreover, they are generally parameterised by a <i>label</i> that refers to the C memory state
in which they would be invoked &#x2013;within the definition we cannot however reference the
special labels <code>Here, Pre, Post</code>. Otherwise parameter passing is by value as in C.
</p>

<p>
The <code>predicate</code> keyword declares Boolean values functions:
</p>

/*@ predicate name_here {Label₀, …, Labelₖ} (type₀ arg₀, …, typeₘ argₘ) =
  @ // A Boolean valued relationship between all these things.

  <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">return</span> 0;

More usefully, there is the need to ensure a given integer is indeed a non-negative
length of an array.

<p>
Notice that we did not specify a memory label.
That's okay, one is provided for us and the entire definition is considered to transpire
at that memory location. In particular, unlike the previous example, we cannot refer to
distinct memory locations &#x2013;after all we haven't named any!
At the call site, the implicit memory location would be <code>Here</code> thereby referring to the
current memory state &#x2013;however we may still explicitly provide a different label at the
call site.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Predicates must be either true or false, but <code>logic</code> functions are methods that
can be invoked in our specifications &#x2013;you may have noticed that C methods <b>cannot</b>
be called in a specification, which is reasonably since they may produce side-effects!
Since assignment, sequence, and loops rely on side effects they now suddenly become
useless and our definitions must rely on recursion.
Such logical functions generally need not worry about runtime issues such as overflow
&#x2013;which however must be handled at the call site, if need be.
</p>

<pre class="example">
/*@ logic return_type function_name {Label₀, …, Labelₖ} (type₀ arg₀, …, typeₘ argₘ) =
  @  // A formula using the arguments argᵢ, possibly at labels Labelᵢ
 */

//@ logic integer factorial(integer n)  =  (n &lt;= 0) ? 1 : n * factorial(n-1);
</pre>

<p>
If we wrote a program that contained many occurrences to <code>factorial</code> then the definition
would need to be invoked each time. If the occurrences all happened, for example, on the
same input, say 12 &#x2013;any larger would be an <code>unsigned int</code> overflow&#x2013; then it might
make matters faster if we simply had that as a <i>lemma</i> that is proven once and used many
times by the underlying provers. Indeed this can be accomplished by using the <code>lemma</code>
phrase, and this can be done for any property.
</p>

<pre class="example">
//@ lemma name_of_property {Label₀, …, Label₀}:  property_here ;

In such cases, we may tell Frama-C to trust our judgement and take our word for it

<p>
Unlike lemmas, which require a proof, axioms are simply assumed to be true.
It is the responsibility of the user to ensure no inconsistencies arise, as in:
</p>

  <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">return</span> 0;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
However, <code>axiomatic</code> definitions of recursive functions are useful since the underlying
provers do not unroll the recursion when possible
&#x2013;after all, we are simply declaring the type of a function and some properties about
it, which incidentally, happen to be its defining equations.

We will be proving code blocks satisfy Hoare triples, but code blocks are essentially
methods with the given predicate acting as a pre-condition and the required predicate
acting as post-condition. As such, we investigate Hoare triples by using methods.
</p>

<p>
A contract stipulates under what conditions a method will behave
&#x2013;if those conditions are not met, then it's behaviour may be arbitrary.
For example, a method may behave in a manner ensuring \\ <code>x &gt; 1/y</code> under the condition <code>y &gt; 0</code>,
and it may do anything it wants &#x2013;such as aborting the system or setting <code>x = -1</code>&#x2013;
when that condition is not met.

All in all, a function call establishes property <i>R</i> precisely when evaluating its
arguments then executing the function body together establish the property.

<p>
Functions permit abstraction over program design since parts may
be constructed independently and also promotes avoidance of repetition.
</p>

<p>
Unlike functional languages where the result of a function is the final
term in its body, imperative languages signal result values by the <code>return</code> keyword;
which immediately stops execution of the function regardless of the keyword's position.
</p>

<p>
Functions which return no value but instead perform some effectful action, i.e., are <i>procedures</i>,
are marked with the <code>void</code> keyword in-place of a return type &#x2013;surprisingly, this ‘return type’
is not a type at all! One cannot declare a variable of type <code>void</code>.
</p>

<p>
Function calls that yield a value are terms whereas those that do not constitute statements.

A <i>program</i> is an sequence of global variables, function declarations, then a special
function called <code>main</code>. Since sequences are ordered, all names are declared before use!
In C, <code>main</code> usually exits with <code>return 0</code>. Global variables tend to pollute
the namespace and are more trouble than they're worth, so we shall ignore them
&#x2013;however they are already included by default since assignment is a top-level construct.
Incidentally, function declarations with no arguments may be used to simulate global
constants.
</p>

<p>
Note that C does not permit function overloading.
Moreover, C uses the same namespace for methods as well as simple variables
&#x2013;which in is not the case in, say, Java which permits naming a method <code>f</code> and a
variable <code>f</code> to obtain the valid invocation <code>f(f)</code>!

Pressing <code>F9</code>, you will notice that we are also checking for runtime errors by using the RTE plugin
whose goal is to ensure the program cannot create runtime errors such as integer overflow,
invalid pointer dereferencing, division by 0, etc.
</p>

<p>
In our case, we have runtime problems that do not crash but instead produce logical errors:
The return value of <code>abs</code> is not positive! Indeed, in addition to the above block, add focus
to the following block by removing the prefix <code>-not</code>, then run the code with <code>F6</code> to see the output.
&#x2013;Remember to undo this alteration when you're done, otherwise the next invocation to frama-c
will take a while dealing with <code>printf</code>!

The WP plugin forms the necessary proof obligations to ensure the program meets its
specification, simplifies them using a module called <code>Qed</code>, then asks a prover such as
<code>Alt-Ergo</code> whether the obligation is provable or not. Sometimes a property is not
verified for two possible reasons:

<ol class="org-ol">

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-4-2-2">
<p>
Notice that our absolute value function has two disjoint behaviours
&#x2013;depending on whether the input is positive or negative.
Each behaviour has some assumptions and some conclusions.
Moreover, our behaviours are
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>disjoint</code>: Every input can only satisfy the assumptions of <i>at most</i> one of the behaviours.
As such, the program is ‘deterministic’: At most one of the behaviours is possible.
&#x2013;The program is really a relation and this ensures it is <i>univalent</i>; i.e., a <i>partial function</i>&#x2013;</li>
<li><code>complete</code>: Every input satisfies the assumptions of <i>at least</i> one of the behaviours.
As such, the program is ‘total’: At least one behaviour is possible.
&#x2013;The program is really a relation and this ensures it is <i>total</i>; i.e., defined on all
inputs&#x2013;</li>
</ul>

<p>
We expressed our behaviours in the forms <code>ensures ⟨assumptions⟩  ==&gt;  ⟨consequences⟩</code>.
However this can get unruly when there are many assumptions and many consequences.
Moreover, expressing disjointness is tedious and error-prone even in our little
example, below, where it becomes the assertion: (<code>val &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; val &gt;= 0) &lt;==&gt; \false</code>.
As such there is the alternative <code>behavior</code> syntax &#x2013;note the American spelling!
Using this syntax, we can ask WP to verify that the behaviours are complete or disjoint,
or both.

Conversely, that maximum is the least upper bound,
<i>x ≤ z  ∧  y ≤ z  ≡  x ↑ y ≤ z</i>, corresponds to the
characterisation of disjunction <i>(p ⇒ r) ∧ (q ⇒ r)  ≡  (p ∨ q) ⇒ r</i>
&#x2013;incidentally this is also known as “case analysis” since one proves
<i>p ∨ q ⇒ r</i> by providing a proofs that if <i>p ∨ q</i> is true due to <i>p</i> then
with <i>p</i> in hand we need to show <i>r</i>, and likewise if <i>p ∨ q</i> is true due to <i>q</i>.

Since function calls may alter memory state, the computation of a term may now
not only produce a value, as before, but also alter the state altogether.
( Foreshadowing: The <code>assigns</code> ACSL keyword! )
</p>

<p>
Since a <code>return</code> interrupts executation, the sequence computation rule
<code>wp (S₁;S₂) = wp S₁ ∘ wp S₂</code> is no longer valid when the execution of <code>S₁</code> causes the
execution of a <code>return</code> thereby necessitating that <code>S₂</code> is not executed.
As we have already seen, we keep the rule valid by simply defining <code>wp U R ≡ true</code>
for any unreachable code <code>U</code> &#x2013;as is <code>S₂</code> when <code>S₁</code> has a return.
</p>

<p>
That is, unreachable assertions are always ‘true’:
They are never in a memory state, and so cannot even be evaluated, let alone be false!

That is, Frama-C considers ‘partial correctness’: A specification is satisfied,
<i>provided</i> it terminates.
</p>

<p>
In addition, since imperative expressions can modify memory, considerations must be
given to the fact arguments of a function are evaluated from left to right.
For example, suppose <code>x,y</code> are imperative constructions yield integers, then
 <code>x + y</code> and <code>y + x</code> are not guaranteed to produce the same behaviour!

The C language does not specify the order of evaluation of function arguments

<h3 id="orgbc9010b"><span class="section-number-3">4.5</span> Passing Arguments by Value and by Reference</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-5">
<p>
Applying the definition of <code>wp</code> to the body of the following <code>swap</code> gives us
<code>wp swap = id</code>, thereby demonstrating that <i>this</i> <code>swap</code> does not change the
values of two variables!
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">void</span> <span style="color: #b58900;">swap</span>(<span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">a</span>, <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">b</span>){ <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">c</span>; c = a; a = b; b = c; }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
The default mechanism of argument passing is that of <i>pass by value</i>:
Only values are sent to function bodies, which cannot alter the original variables.
Indeed, what should <code>swap(x+y, 2)</code> perform if it were to “alter the given variables”?
</p>

<p>
To say that two <i>distinct</i> variables share the <i>same location</i> in memory
requires us to formally introduce a notion of location that variables may reference.
Rather than introduce a new such type, C makes the convention that certain numeric
values act &#x2013;possibly dual roles&#x2013; as reference locations.
</p>

<p>
Hence we can associate variables to references which are then associated to values.
That is, a state now consists of two pieces: An <i>environment</i> mapping variables to
references and a <i>memory state</i> mapping references to values.
The key insight is that the environment may be non-injective thereby associating
distinct variables to the same reference thereby permitting them to alter the shared value.
Incidentally, the shared value can be thought of as a buffer for message passing between
the two variable agents. Neato!
</p>

<p>
In C, passing by reference is not a primitive construct, but it can be simulated.
The type of references that can be associated with a value of type <code>T</code> in memory
is written <code>T*</code> in C. Incidentally, the dereference operator is written <code>*</code> in C.
For example, in environment <code>u ↦ r₁</code> and memory state <code>r₁ ↦ r₂, r₂ ↦ 4</code> we have
that <code>u</code> has <i>value</i> <code>r₂</code> whereas <code>*u</code> has <i>value</i> <code>4</code>. That is, <code>u</code> is a reference value at location <code>r₁</code>
having contents <code>r₂</code>, which when dereferenced refer to the value contained in location <code>r₂</code>
which is 4.
</p>

<p>
The reference associated with variable <code>x</code> in a C environment is written <code>&amp;x</code>.
E.g., in environment <code>x ↦ r</code> and memory state <code>r ↦ 4</code>, the value of <code>x</code> is the integer 4
whereas the value of <code>&amp;x</code> is the reference <code>r</code>. Moreover, the value of <code>*&amp;x</code> is the integer 4.
</p>

<pre class="example">
&amp;_ : ∀{T} →  Variable T → Reference T   -- “address of”
*_ : ∀{T} → Reference T → T             -- “value of”

-- Using ‘value equality’:
Inverses:  ∀ a : Var T.  *&amp;a   ≈ a
Inverses:  ∀ r : Ref T.  &amp;(*r) ≈ r

If <code>t</code> is an expression of type <code>T*</code> then the C language has the assignment
construct <code>*t = u</code>: The reference of <code>t</code> is now associated with the value
of <code>u</code>. The notation alludes to this executional behaviour:
The contents of <code>t</code>, i.e., <code>*t</code>, now refer to the value of <code>u</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example, <code>*&amp;x = u</code> has the same behaviour as the assignment <code>x = u</code>.

The compiler gives us
<code>warning: function returns address of local variable [-Wreturn-local-addr].</code>
We may thus turn on that warning &#x2013;and all warnings really!&#x2013; so that it becomes
an error at compile time.
</p>

Since we used a reference that is not declared in memory, C does not produce
a compile error but the runtime result is unpredictable. Execute the above

It can only be used in the post-condition and it denotes the value <i>before</i> execution
of the method body. If we want to access the value at a particular memory state,
we simply refer to a label at that time frame using the <code>\at</code> construct &#x2013;see below.

<p>
Besides user-defined labels, <code>\at</code> can also be used with the built-in labels:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>Pre</code> : Value <i>before</i> function call.</li>
<li><code>Post</code>: Value <i>after</i> function call. &#x2013;Can only be used in the post-condition.</li>
<li><code>Here</code>: Value at the current program point. &#x2013;This' the default for stand-alone variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Whereas <code>\old</code> can only be used in the post-condition, <code>\at</code> can be used anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Notice that we used the built-in <code>\valid</code> to ensure that access to pointers is safe
&#x2013;i.e., pointing to a real memory location&#x2013; thereby avoiding runtime errors.
We may also write <code>\valid(p + (l .. u))</code> to express the validity of pointers
<code>p + i</code> for <i>l ≤ i ≤ u</i> &#x2013;this will be helpful when working with arrays.
Moreover, when working with constant, non-mutable, pointers, or if we wish to
be more accurate, we may use <code>\valid_read(p)</code> to express that the pointer <code>p</code> is valid for
read-access only &#x2013;no writing permitted.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-6">
<p>
Since methods may alter state, thereby producing side-effects, it becomes important
to indicate which global and local variables a method assigns to
&#x2013;that way its effects are explicit. We use the <code>assigns</code> clause to declare this.
Unless stated otherwise, WP assumes a method can modify anything in memory;
as such, the use of <code>assigns</code> becomes almost always necessary.
When a method has no side-effects, thereby not assigning to anything, we may
declare <code>assigns \nothing</code>.

<p>
Finally it is to be noted that <code>assigns</code> do not occur within a <code>behavior</code>
&#x2013;it occurs before by declaring <i>all</i> variables that may be altered, then
each <code>behavior</code> would include a clause for the unmodified variables by indicating
their new value is equal to their <code>\old</code> one.

<h3 id="orgb4dc9d3"><span class="section-number-3">4.7</span> Pointer Aliasing: <code>separated</code></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-7">
<p>
The raison d'être of pointers is to be able to have aliases for memory locations.
When the pointers refer to simple data, we may act <i>functionally</i> in that we copy
data to newly allocated memory locations. However, sometimes &#x2013;such as when we program
with linked lists&#x2013; copying large amounts of data is unreasonable and we may simply
want to alter given pointers directly. When the given pointers are <i>identical</i> then an
alteration to one of them is actually an alteration to the rest!
</p>

<p>
When we program with lists, we shall see that if we catenate two lists by altering
the first to eventually point to the second then it all works.
However, if we catenate a list with itself then the resulting alteration
is not the catenation of the list with itself but instead is an
infinite cycle of the first list! &#x2013;We'll see this later on.
</p>

<p>
Here is a simpler example,
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c" id="org3de682a"><span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">#include</span><span style="color: #2aa198;">&lt;limits.h&gt;</span>

{
  *fst += *snd;
}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice since we're only assigning to <code>*fst</code>, we need not explicitly state
<code>ensures *snd == \old(*snd)</code>. However, in the event that <code>fst</code> and <code>snd</code> both point
to the same memory location, then we actually are assigning to both!
As such the final <code>ensures</code> is not necessarily true either!
</p>

<p>
We need to uncomment the <code>separated</code> declaration: The memory locations are distinct.
</p>

<p>
Notice that in the final call below, since the pre-condition to
<code>increment_first_by_second</code> fails, we have breached its contract and therefore
no longer guarenteed the behaviour it <code>ensures</code>.
Since the contract does not tells what happens when we breach it, anything is possible
and so anything is “true”!

As a matter of abstraction, or separation of concerns, a program may be split up
into an interface of declarations &#x2013;a ‘header’ file&#x2013; and an implementation file.
Frama-C permits this approach by allowing us to use a specification of a declared
method, which it assumes to be correct, and so we need to verify its precondition
is established whenever we call it. In some sense, for proof purposes, this allows
us to ‘postulate’ a correct method and use it elsewhere &#x2013;this idea is very helpful
when we want to use an external libary's methods but do not &#x2013;or cannot&#x2013; want to prove them.

Thus far we have only considered built-in types, we now turn to considering
user-defined types that are more complex and are composites of simpler types
by using the <i>record</i> construct.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Record ≈ Tuple with named fields</li>
</ul>

<p>
A tuple <code>x = (x₀, x₁, …, xₙ)</code> is a function over the domain <code>0..n</code>, but in programming
the domain is usually of <i>named fields, labels,</i> and then it is called a <i>record</i>.
E.g., <code>{name = "Jasim", age = 27, language = "ar"}</code> is a record.
In the case that the labels <i>are</i> numbers, we obtain the notion of an <i>array</i>.
</p>

<p>
In other languages, this may be known as a <code>class</code>.
In Haskell this is the <code>data</code> keyword with ‘record syntax’,
and in Agda we may go on to use the <code>record</code> keyword.
</p>

<p>
C records are known as <i>structures</i> and they are just a list of
labels with their types. In using <code>struct</code> types, the <code>struct</code>
keyword must precede the type name in all declarations.

<h3 id="org5481f16"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Allocation of a Record</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Recall that a variable declaration associates the variable with a reference to
the variable in memory &#x2013;i.e., it's address&#x2013;,
moreover this reference is associated a value for the variable.</li>

<li>Record variables declared without a value are given the special default value <code>null</code>.</li>

<li>In Java, a record variable's reference is not directly associated with a record in memory!
It is usually associated with <code>null</code> or another reference.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To associate a record with a variable, we need to create memory large enough to contain the record
contents. Some languages use the keyword <code>new</code> to accomplish this task: Create a new reference
and associated it with the record variable being defined.
</p>

<p>
For example, in Java,
</p>
<pre class="example">
class Pair
{
  int fst;
  int snd;
}

Pair p = new Pair();
</pre>
<p>
The resulting environment is <code>p ↦ r</code> and the resulting memory state is
<code>r ↦ r', r' ↦ {fst = 0, snd = 0}</code>. Note that default values are used.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A reference that was added to memory by the construct <code>new</code> is called a <i>cell</i>.</li>
<li>The set of memory cells is called a <i>heap</i>.</li>
<li>The operation that adds a new cell to the memory state is called <i>allocation</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Interestingly in C the creation of records does <i>not</i> allocate cells and so there
is no need for the <code>new</code> keyword. Indeed record variables cannot ever have the value <code>null</code>.
C directly associates a variable with a reference which has the record contents as its value.
That is, C has one less level of indirection than is found in Java.
E.g., <code>struct Pair p = {2, 3};</code> gives us environment <code>p ↦ r</code> and memory state <code>r ↦ {fst = 2, snd = 3}</code>,
whereas Java would have <code>p ↦ r′</code> in the environment and <code>r′ ↦ r</code> additionally in the memory state
That is to say, <i>records in Java correspond to references to records in C</i>
and so Java access notation <code>r.f</code> is rendered in C as <code>(*r).f</code>.
</p>

<p>
Remember that references are themselves first-class values and it is possible for a
reference to be associated to another reference.

<div id="outline-container-orgec54702" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgec54702"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> The Four Constructs of Records</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Records are usually handled using four constructs:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Defining a record type; e.g., using <code>class</code> or <code>struct</code>.</li>
<li>Allocating a cell; e.g., using <code>new</code> or <code>malloc</code>.</li>
<li>Accessing a field; e.g., <code>myRecord.myField</code>.</li>
<li>Assigning to a field; e.g., <code>myRecord.myField = myValue</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Understanding records in a language is thus tantamount to understanding
these fundamental basics. E.g., in functional languages, assignment to a field
is essentially record copying or, more efficiently, reference redirection.
Incidentally, neither Haskell nor Agda make use of the <code>new</code> keyword:
Declarations <i>must be</i> accompanied by initialisation which indicate the need
for cell allocation &#x2013;consequently there is no need for a <code>null</code> value.
The use of <code>new</code> may be used for careful efficiency optimisations,
or memory management &#x2013;which is rarely brought to the forefront in functional languages.
</p>

<p>
The act of assigning to each field of a record
is so common that they are usually placed into a so-called <i>constructor</i> method.

<h4 id="org95899bb"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.1</span> Assignment</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-1">
<p>
Suppose <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are variables of type <code>Pair</code>, with environment and memory state:
</p>
<pre class="example">
locations  =  x ↦ r₁, y ↦ r₂
values     =  r₁ ↦ r₃, r₂ ↦ r₄, r₃ ↦ {fst = 3, snd = 5}, r₄ ↦ {fst = 7, snd = 9}
</pre>
<p>
Then assignment <code>y ≔ x</code> results in:
</p>
<pre class="example">
locations  =  x ↦ r₁, y ↦ r₂
values     =  r₁ ↦ r₃, r₂ ↦ r₃, r₃ ↦ {fst = 3, snd = 5}, r₄ ↦ {fst = 7, snd = 9}
                      -Change Here-
</pre>
<p>
That is, the value of <code>x</code> is computed which is the reference <code>r₃</code>
&#x2013;since <code>value (location x) ≈ value r₁ ≈ r₃</code>&#x2013;
and we associate this value with the location of <code>y</code>, that is, reference <code>r₂</code>.
</p>

<p>
Notice that now no variable has the value of <code>r₄</code> and so it is considered <i>garbage</i>
in our state. Moreover, nothing can get to it since values are only associated with
locations, none of which have address <code>r₄</code>. Hence there is no <i>observable</i> affect to
their absence or presence. We want to recycle the physical memory
or else we would quickly run out of memory. A <i>garbage collector</i> is an automated
system that collects and recycles such cells. Older languages like C do not
have such a system and so memory must be managed by hand.
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, henceforth <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> <b>share</b> the values of the record thereby all alterations,
through either variable, are observable by the other.
</p>

<p>
Since <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are reference values, the assignment makes <code>x == y</code> a true statement
since they <i>share</i> the same cell. This is known as <i>physical equality</i>.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes we wish for two variables to <i>share</i> a single integer, which may
not be possible with built-in types, but can be accomplished by using <i>wrapper record types</i>:
Records that have a lone single field. This idea of `boxing up' primitive types
allows us, for example, to define functions with arguments that are passed by reference
thereby modifying their arguments; such as the <code>swap</code> function that swaps the contents of its
arguments.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3225ae0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org3225ae0"><span class="section-number-4">5.3.2</span> Copy</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-5-3-2">
<p>
If we instead execute <code>y.fst ≔ x.fst; y.snd ≔ x.snd</code>
Then the resulting state is:
</p>
<pre class="example">
locations  =  x ↦ r₁, y ↦ r₂
values     =  r₁ ↦ r₃, r₂ ↦ r₄, r₃ ↦ {fst = 3, snd = 5}, r₄ ↦ {fst = 3, snd = 5}

</pre>

<p>
In this case, any alteration to <code>x</code>'s values are <i>not</i> observable by <code>y</code>.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, in this case, all fields are equal and so we have <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
are <i>structurally equal</i>. This notion is sometimes called <code>equals method</code>
and the previous is <code>equals equals (==)</code>.

<h3 id="orgfc2132a"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Arrays</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
<i>Arrays</i> are essentially records whose labels are numeric <i>and</i> all labels have
the same type. The number of fields of an array is determined during allocation
of the array, and not during the declaration of its type, as is the case with records.
This trade-off makes arrays more desirable in certain contexts.
</p>

<p>
The fields are usually numbered <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code>, where <code>n</code> is the number of fields.
</p>

<p>
Once an array is allocated, its size cannot be changed.
&#x2013;Stop &amp; think: Why not?
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Arrays of type <code>T</code> are denoted by <code>T[]</code> in C/Java.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Matrices, or arrays of arrays, are denoted by <code>T[][]</code> with access
by <code>T[i][j]</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>
C arrays, like records, are not allocated.
Consequently, their size cannot be determined by allocation and so must be
  a part of their type.
</p>

<p>
C arrays of type <code>T</code> of length <code>n</code> are declared using the mixfix syntax: <code>T x[n];</code>
Each element of the array is arbitrary &#x2013;with no designated defaults&#x2013;
so it is best to initialise them. E.g., <code>int x[10] = {};</code> sets all elements of
the array to 0.

<p>
However, C arrays differ from C records in that array variables are actually
references that are associated in memory with an array. Consequently, array
arguments to methods are automatically pass by reference!
</p>

<p>
Moreover this means the assignment <code>t[k] = u</code> works in a rather general sense:
<code>t</code> suffices to be any expression whose <i>value</i> is a reference associated in memory
with an array.

<p>
Some remarks are in order.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>\valid_read(array + (0 .. N - 1))</code> ensures that the memory addresses
<code>array + 0, ..., array + N-1</code> can be read &#x2013;as discussed when introducing <code>\valid</code>.</li>

<li>The loop continues as long as we have not yet found the element.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>As such, every index thus far differs from the element sought after.</li>
<li>That is, forall index <i>i</i> in the array bounds, we have <i>array[i] ≠ element</i>.</li>
<li>This invariant is stated using the <code>forall</code> syntax.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>The variable naming <code>n, N</code> is intended to be suggestive:
When <i>n = N</i> then we have traversed the whole array.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We began at 0 and are working upward to <i>N</i>.</li>
<li>At each step, we traverse the array by one more item
thereby decreasing the amount of items remaining &#x2013;which is <i>N - n</i>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>If it is <i>provable</i> that some index contains the desired element,
then in that case our program ensures the output result is a valid index.</li>

<li>The ACSL type <code>integer</code> is preferable to the C type <code>int</code> since it is not constrained by
any representation limitations and instead acts more like its pure mathematical counterpart ℤ.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is important to note that the universal ‘∀’ uses <code>==&gt;</code> to delimit the
range from the body predicate, whereas the existential ‘∃’ uses <code>&amp;&amp;</code>
&#x2013;this observation is related to the “trading laws” for quantifiers.
</p>

<table>


<colgroup>
<col  class="org-left">

<col  class="org-left">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="org-left"><code>\forall type x; r(x) ==&gt; p(x)</code></td>
<td class="org-left">Every element <code>x</code> in range <code>r</code> satisfies <code>p</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class="org-left"><code>\exists type x; r(x) &amp;&amp; p(x)</code></td>
<td class="org-left">Some  element <code>x</code> in range <code>r</code> satisfies <code>p</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>
Notice the striking difference between
the <code>\exists integer x; \false &amp;&amp; even x</code>
&#x2013;which is unprovable since false is never true!&#x2013;
and <code>\exists integer x; \false ==&gt; even x</code>
&#x2013;which can be satisfied by infinitely many <code>x</code>, since false implies anything.
</p>
<p>
Of course we could start at the end of the array and “work down” until
we find the element, or otherwise, say, return -1. Let's do so without using
a new local variable <code>n</code>.

<p>
Notice that the invariants are getting way too long &#x2013;and worse: Repetitive!
We can abstract common formulae into more general and reusable shapes by
declaring them as ACSL logical functions &#x2013;keep reading!
</p>

<p>
On an unrelated note, sometimes we try to prove a program that we just
coded incorrectly, so if things are going nowhere then maybe try a few tests
to ensure you're on the right track.

The definition of <code>wp</code> for function calls is correct provided the function body
itself only contains invocations to <i>previously</i> defined functions?
</p>

<p>
What about <i>recursive function definitions</i>:
Definitions invoking the function being defined or invoking functions that invoke
functions that eventually invoke the function currently being defined?
</p>

<p>
Since invocations are delegated to the state, which handles all defined names,
we may invoke whatever function provided its name is found.
Since C requires names to be declared before use, we may have mutually recursive
functions by ‘prototyping’: Declaring the function signature, then at some point
providing the actual implementation.

Anyhow, e.g., <code>void f(int x){ f(x); }</code> has the definition of <code>wp f(x)</code> using the value of <code>wp f(x)</code>
and so is circular. How can this be avoided?
</p>

<p>
Note that a <i>recursive definition</i> is <b>not</b> just a definition that uses the object which it
is defining. Otherwise, the previous <code>f</code> might as well have been the definition of
the factorial function that on input <code>x</code> simply invokes itself; then again it could
have been any function!

We generally think of recursive definitions as definitions by usual ℕ-induction, however
this is not absolutely true.
E.g., the following function at <code>n</code> not only relies on
values on smaller inputs but also on values at larger inputs to compute the value at <code>n</code>!

</div>

<p>
Similarly the Ackermann function is a recursive function that has been proven
to be undefinable using only nested definitions by ℕ-induction.
( However, since ℕ×ℕ is well-ordered, it is a valid definition. )
</p>
 </details>

<p>
We may try to remove recursive calls by replacing every recursive call with
the function body itself, which then has a new recursive call. We may continue
to expand forever by replacing recursive calls with the original function body.
The “result” will be an non-recursive program that is infinitely long.
</p>

<p>
Thus, recursive programs, like <code>while</code> loops, are a means of expressing infinite
programs and, like <code>while</code> loops, they introduce the possibility of non-termination.
</p>

<p>
As for <code>while</code> loops, we can approximate the infinitely long non-recursive program
by simply giving-up on the <code>n</code>-th expansion, not making any more recursive calls.
Essentially, we do <code>n</code> recursive calls then give-up if the program has not completed.
Hence, we again consider the limit.

<div id="outline-container-org7a76a2e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7a76a2e"><span class="section-number-3">7.1</span> Recursive Definitions and Fixed Point Equations</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<p>
A recursive function such as the factorial function can be seen as
an equation where the unknown variable is the function currently being defined.
For example, the factorial function is the <i>unique partial function</i> <code>f</code> satisfying
the equation
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">f  <span style="color: #b58900;">&#8776;</span> (x <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8614;</span> <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">if</span> x <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8776;</span> 0 <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">then</span> 1 <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">else</span> x <span style="color: #268bd2;">*</span> f(x<span style="color: #268bd2;">-</span>1))
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This equation has the form <code>f ≈ F(f)</code>, so it is a “fixed point equation”.
</p>

<p>
Since recursive functions may not terminate, the functions they describe
are partial. It can be proven that any fixed point equation <i>always</i> has
at least one solution; i.e., it defines at least one partial function on the integers.
For example, the equation <code>f ≈ (x ↦ 1 + f(x))</code> corresponding to
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-c"><span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #b58900;">loop</span>(<span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">int</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">n</span>){ <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">return</span> 1 + loop(n); }
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Has one solution: The empty function, which is not defined on any input.
</p>

<p>
The set of possible solutions can be ordered by inclusion
of their graphs and so one of them is the smallest.
Incidentally, this least solution is also obtained by the aforementioned limit!
</p>

<p>
E.g., every function is a solution to the equation <code>f ≈ (x ↦ f x)</code>.

<p>
( Notice that <i>¬(i ≤ n)[i ≔ 1]  ≡  n = 0</i> when considering <i>n : ℕ</i>. )
</p>

<p>
Hence if we remove assignments, then the memory state for computation is
always empty and so sequences and loops become useless. We are left with
only variable declarations, function calls, and the built-in operations.
This is the <i>functional core</i> of the language and it is surprisingly as powerful
as the imperative core. Why? Recall that a term, or statement, can be thought
of as a (partial) function of its free variables; now the functions obtained
this way using only the functional core are the same as those obtained by also
using the whole of the imperative core!
Note that omitting recursion falsifies this result.

<p>
Running a few test inputs, it can be seen that this program
sets <code>y</code> to be the power of <code>x</code>. Further testing may reveal interesting
issues when <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> refer to the same memory location!
</p>

<details class="code-details"> <summary> <strong> <font face="Courier" size="3" color="green"> Details </font> </strong> </summary> <pre class="example">
⟨x = 0, y = 0⟩ ↦ ⟨x = 3, y = 1⟩
⟨x = 1, y = 2⟩ ↦ ⟨x = 5, y = 2⟩
⟨x = 3, y = 4⟩ ↦ ⟨x = 5, y = 8⟩
⟨x = 5, y = 6⟩ ↦ ⟨x = 5, y = 32⟩
⟨x = 7, y = 8⟩ ↦ ⟨x = 5, y = 128⟩
⟨x = 0, y = 99⟩ ↦ ⟨x = 3, y = 1⟩

x == y  ⇒  Segmentation Fault
</pre>
 </details>

<p>
With this guidance in hand, we aim to axiomatise the power function:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">  @                 pow(b, m + n) == pow(b, m) * pow(b, n);</span>

<span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">  @ }</span>
<span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">  */</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Notice that there are infinitely many solutions <code>f</code> to the equations
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>pow_zero</code>: <i>f(0) = 1</i></li>
<li><code>pow_homomorphism</code>: <i>f(m + n) = f(m) * f(n)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
Which ones? Since every natural number is of the form <i>1 + 1 + ⋯ + 0</i>
the second requirement yields \\ <i>f(n) = f (1 + 1 + ⋯ + 0) = f 1 * f 1 * ⋯ f 1 * f 0;</i>
which by the first requirement simplifies to <i>f(n) = (f 1)ⁿ</i>.
Hence for any choice of number <i>f(1) : ℕ</i>, we obtain a function <i>f</i>
that satisfies these definitions. If we want <i>f</i> to be the <i>n</i> product of a number
<i>b</i> then we need to insist <i>f 1 = b</i> &#x2013;which is just <code>pow_one</code>!
</p>

<p>
From the axioms, we obtain some useful lemmas.

Then to see the code generated by this file press <code>M-x</code> then enter <code>show-code</code> then enter;
alternatively, press <code>C-x C-e</code> after the final parenthesis: (show-code).
</p>

<p>
My definition of <code>(show-code)</code> begins with closing the code buffer if it exists,
then continue by extracting the most recent code and displaying it below the current buffer.
The definition of <code>(interpret)</code> is nearly the same except we switch to an output buffer,
and create it if it doesn't exist.
Note that our interpretation command is essentially the following command line invocation:
<code>NAME=myfilename ; gcc $NAME.c -o $NAME.exe ; ./$NAME.exe</code>

The <code>frama-c-no-gui</code> command tries to find where an error happens by placing the cursor
near an unproven assertion. It does so by looking for the phrase <code>false</code> in the shell output
buffer after the <code>frama-c</code> program is invoked. If it cannot find it, you are placed at
the end of the buffer and, ideally but not necessarily, should see all goals have passed.

Numbers are the lengths of lists which are the flattenings of trees which are
the spannings of graphs.
Unlike the first three, graphs have <i>two</i> underlying types of interest
&#x2013;the vertices and the edges&#x2013; and it is getting to grips with this complexity
that we attempt to tackle by considering their ‘algebraic’ counterpart: Categories.
</p>

<p>
In our exploration of what graphs could possibly be and their relationships to lists are,
we shall <i>mechanise,</i> or <i>implement,</i> our claims since there will be many details and it is easy
to make mistakes &#x2013;moreover as a self-learning project, I'd feel more confident to make
<b>bold</b> claims when I have a proof assistant checking my work ;-)
</p>

<p>
Assuming slight familiarity with the Agda programming language, we motivate the need for
basic concepts of category theory with the aim of discussing adjunctions with
a running example of a detailed construction and proof of a free functor.
Moreover, the article contains a host of <code>exercises</code> whose solutions can be found in the
literate source file. Raw Agda code can be found <a href="https://github.com/alhassy/AgdaCheatSheet/blob/master/PathCat.agda">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Since the read time for this article is more than two hours, excluding the interspersed
exercises, it may help to occasionally consult a some reference sheets:

</p>

<p>
Coming from a background in order theory, I love Galois Connections and so
our categorical hammer will not be terminal objects nor limits, but rather adjunctions.
As such, <i>everything is an adjunction</i> is an apt slogan for us :-)

Lists give free monoids \(ℒ\, A = (\List\, A, +\!+, [])\)
&#x2014;a monoid \(𝒮 = (S, ⊕, 0_⊕)\) is a triple consisting of a set \(S\) with a binary operation
\(⊕\) on it that is associative and has a unit, \(0_⊕\).
That it is ‘free’ means that to define a structure-preserving map between monoids
\((\List\, A, +\!+, []) \,⟶\, (S, ⊕, 0_⊕)\) it suffices to only provide a map between their
carriers \(\List\, A → S\) &#x2014;freedom means that plain old maps between types freely,
at no cost or effort, give rise to maps that preserve monoid structure.
Moreover, the converse also holds and in-fact we have a bijection:
\[
  (ℒ\, A ⟶ 𝒮) \qquad≅\qquad (A ⟶ 𝒰\, 𝒮)
\]
Where we write \(𝒰\, (S, ⊕, 0_⊕) = S\) for the operation that gives us the 𝒰nderlying carrier
of a monoid.
</p>

<p>
Loosely put, one says we have an ‘adjunction’, written \(ℒ ⊣ 𝒰\).
</p>

<p>
Observe that natural numbers <code>ℕ ≅ List Unit</code> are a monoid whose operation is commutative.
By using different kinds of elements <code>A</code> &#x2013;and, importantly, still not imposing any equations&#x2013;
we lose commutativity with <code>List A</code>.
Then by generalising further to binary trees <code>BinTree A</code>, we lose associtivity and identity
are are only left with a set and an operation on it &#x2014;a structure called a ‘magma’.
</p>

<p>
This is the order that one usually learns about these inductively built structures.
One might be curious as to what the next step up is in this hierarchy of generalisations.
It is a non-inductive type called a ‘graph’ and in this note we investigate them by
comparison to lists.
Just as we shifted structures in the hierarchy, we will
move to a setting called a ‘category’ &#x2014;such are more structured than magmas
but less restrictive than monoids.
</p>

<p>
For those who know category theory, this article essentially formalises the
often seen phrase “consider the category generated by this diagram, or graph”.
Indeed every category is essentially a free category over a graph but with
additional equations that ‘confuse’ two paths thereby declaring, e.g., that
one edge is the composition of two other edges.

<p>
Before reading any further please ingrain into your mind that the Agda keyword
<code>Set</code> is read “type”! This disparity is a historical accident.
</p>

<p>
Since the Agda prelude is so simple, the core language doesn’t even come with Booleans or numbers by default
&#x2014;they must be imported from the standard library. This is a pleasant feature.
As a result, Agda code tends to begin with a host of imports.

Let us make equational-style proofs available for any type.

<p>
We intend our proofs to be sequences of formulae interleaved with
justifications for how the formulae are related. At times, the justifications
are by definition and so may be omitted, but we may want to mention them
for presentational &#x2013;pedagogical?&#x2013; purposes. Hence, we introduce the
combinator notation <code>lhs ≡⟨" by definition of something "⟩′ rhs</code>.

While we’re making synonyms for readability, let’s make another:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Example usage would be to prove
<code>mor G (mor F Id) ≡ mor G Id</code> directly by <code>≡-cong (mor G) (id F)</code>
which can be written more clearly as
<code>functor F preserves-identities even-under (mor G)</code>,
while longer it is also much clearer and easier to read and understand
&#x2013;self-documenting in some sense.

<p>
Interestingly, our first calculational proof is in section 5 when
we introduced an large 𝒞𝒶𝓉egory.

A ‘graph’ is just a parallel-pair of maps,

</pre>
</div>
<p>
This of-course captures the usual notion of a set of nodes <code>V</code> and a set of directed and labelled
edges <code>E</code> where an edge <code>e</code> begins at <code>src e</code> and concludes at <code>tgt e</code>.
</p>

<p>
What is good about this definition is that it can be phrased in any category: <code>V</code> and <code>E</code> are
any two objects and <code>src, tgt</code> are a parallel pair of morphisms between them.
How wonderful! We can study the notion of graphs in arbitrary categories!
&#x2014;This idea will be made clearer when categories and functors are formally introduced.
</p>

<p>
However, the notion of structure-preserving map between graphs, or ‘graph-maps’ for short,
then becomes:
</p>

<p>
( The fancy 𝒢 and ⟶ are obtained in Agda input mode by <code>\McG</code> and <code>\--&gt;</code>, respectively. )
</p>

<p>
This is a bit problematic in that we have two proof obligations and at a first glance it is not
at all clear their motivation besides ‘‘structure-preserving’’.
</p>

<p>
However, our aim is in graphs in usual type theory, and as such we can use a definition that is
equivalent in this domain: A graph is a
type <code>V</code> of vertices and a ‘type’ <code>v ⟶ v’</code> of edges for each pair of vertices <code>v</code> and <code>v’</code>.

While equivalent, this two-piece definition is preferable over the four-piece one given
earlier since it means less proof-obligations and less constructions in general, but the same
expressiblity. Yay!

However, we must admit that a slight downside of the typed approach
&#x2013;the two-piece definition&#x2013; is now
we may need to use the following ‘shifting’ combinators:
They shift, or slide, the edge types.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-- casting
_⟫_ : ∀{x y y’} →  (x ⟶ y) → (y ≡ y’) → (x ⟶ y’)
e ⟫ ≡-refl = e

-- Casting leaves the edge the same, only type information changes
≅-⟫ : ∀{x y y’} {e : x ⟶ y} (y≈y’ : y ≡ y’) → e ≅ (e ⟫ y≈y’)
≅-⟫ ≡-refl = ≅-refl
</pre>

<p>
Such is the cost of using a typed-approach.
</p>

<p>
Even worse, if we use homogeneous equality then we’d have the ghastly operator
</p>
<pre class="example">
≡-⟫ : ∀{x y y’} {e : x ⟶ y} (y≈y’ : y ≡ y’) → e ⟫ y≈y’ ≡ (≡-subst (λ ω → x ⟶ ω) y≈y’ e)

However, it seems that our development does not even make use of these.
Lucky us! However, it is something to be aware of.

A <i>signature</i> consists of ‘sort symbols’ and ‘function symbols’ each of which is associated source-sorts
and a target-sort &#x2013;essentially it is an interface in the programming sense of the word thereby providing
a lexicon for a language.
A <i>model</i> or <i>algebra</i> of a language is an interpretation of the sort symbols as sets and an interpretation of the
function symbols as functions between those sets; i.e., it is an <i>implementation</i> in programming terms.
Later you may note that instead of sets and functions we may use the objects and morphisms of
a fixed category instead, and so get a model in that category.

For example, the signature of monoids consists of a single sort symbol <code>C</code> &#x2013;which can be
interpreted as the carrier of the monoid&#x2013; and two function symbols <code>m , u</code>
&#x2013;which can be interpreted as the monoid multiplication and unit&#x2013; with source-target
sort lists <code>((),C) , ((C,C), C)</code> &#x2014;some would notate this by <code>u :→ C , m : C × C → C</code>.
</p>

</pre>
</div>

<p>
Generalising on monoids by typing the multiplication we obtain
the signature of categories which consists of three sort symbols <code>O, A, C</code> &#x2013;which can be
interepreted as objects, arrows, and composable pairs of arrows&#x2013; and four function symbols
<code>⨾ , src, tgt, id</code> with source-target sort lists <code>(C,A) , (A,O) , (A,O) , (O,A)</code>
&#x2014;notice that only a language of symbols
has been declared without any properties besides those of typing. If we discard <code>C, ⨾, id</code> we
then obtain the signature of graphs. Without knowing what categories are, we have seen that their
signatures are similar to both the graph and monoid signatures and so expect their logics to
also be similar. Moreover we now have a few slogans,
\[\color{green}{\text{Categories are precisely typed monoids!}}\]
\[\color{green}{\text{Categories are precisely graphs with a monoidal structure!}}\]
\[\color{green}{\text{Categories are precisely coherently constructive lattices!}}\]
</p>

<p>
( The last one is completely unmotivated from our discussion, but it's a good place for the slogan and
  will be touched on when we look at examples of categories. )
</p>

<p>
A signature can be visualised in the plane by associating a dot for each sort symbol and an arrow
for each function symbol such that the arrow has a tail from each sort in the associated function
symbols source sorts list and the end of the arrow is the target sort of the sort symbol.
That is, a signature can be visualised as a hyper-graph.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A signature whose function symbols each have only one sort symbol for source-sorts is called a
‘graph signature’ since it corresponds to &#x2014;or can be visualised as&#x2014; a graph.</li>

<li>Then a model of a graph (signature) <code>𝒢</code> is an interpreation/realisation of the graph’s vertices
as sets and the graph’s edges as functions between said sets.</li>

<li>A model of <code>𝒢</code> is nothing more than a graph morphism
<code>𝒢 ⟶ 𝒮e𝓉</code>, where <code>𝒮e𝓉</code> is the graph with vertices being sets and edges being functions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Notice that a <code>Graph₀</code> is precisely a model of the graph <code>• ⇉ •</code>, which consists of
two vertices and two edges from the first vertex to the second vertex.
We will return to this point ;-)
</p>

<p>
Before we move on, it is important to note that a signature does not capture any
constraints required on the symbols &#x2013;e.g., a monoid is the monoid signature as well
as the constraint that the 2-arity operation is associative and the 0-arity operation is its unit.
More generally, a <i>specification</i> consists of a signature declaring symbols of interest,
along with a set of sentences over it that denote axioms or constraints.
In programming parlance, this is an interface consisting of types and functions
that need to be provided and implemented, along with constraints that are usually documented in comments.
Unsurprisingly, models of specifications also form categories.

In this section we introduce the notion of a ‘‘poor-man’s category’’ along with the notion of
structure preserving transformations and structure preserving transformations between such
transformations. The former are called <i>functors</i> and the latter are known as <i>natural transformations</i>
and are considered one of the most important pieces of the fundamentals of category theory;
as such, we discuss them at length.
Afterwards, we relate this section back to our motivating discussion of graphs.

<h3 id="Strict-Categories"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> Strict Categories</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Strict-Categories">
<p>
A category, like a monoid, is a a few types and operations for which some equations hold.
However, to discuss equations a notion of equality is needed and rather than enforce one
outright it is best to let it be given. This is a ‘set’ in constructive mathematics:
A type with an <code>E</code>-quivalence relation on it &#x2014;also called a <i>setoid</i> or an <code>E</code>-set.
However, then the structure must have a few added axioms: The operations must be congruences,
i.e., preserve the equivalence relation, and structure-preserving maps must also be congruences.
</p>

<p>
For our purposes we will use propositional equality and point-wise propositional equality,
and as such most of the proofs fall out of the fact that propositional equality is an equivalence.
However, this setoid structure becomes a bit of a noise, without providing any real insight for our uses,
and the issues of equivalences will be a distraction from the prime focus.
Instead, for our two cases where we use point-wise propositional,
we will postulate two forms of extensionality. Without question this is not a general approach
&#x2014;then again, our aim is not to develop a library for category theory, which has already been
done so elegantly by Kahl who calls it the <a href="http://relmics.mcmaster.ca/RATH-Agda/RATH-Agda-2.0.0.pdf">RATH-Agda</a> project.

However, similar to nearly everything else in this document, we can leave the setoid approach as an exercise
for the reader, which of course has solutions being in the literate source.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, lest you’re not convinced that my usage of extensionality is at all acceptable,
then note that others have used it to simplify their presentations; e.g.,
<a href="http://cs.ioc.ee/~tarmo/papers/jfr14.pdf">Relative monads formalised</a>.
Such ‘appeal to authority’ is for the lazy reader who dares not think for him- or her-self,
otherwise one ought to read up on the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/principle+of+equivalence">evils</a>
of using equality instead of equivalence relations so as to understand
<a href="http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf">when one thing is really another</a>.
</p>

<p>
The diligent reader may be interested to know that Maarten Fokkinga has written a very
<a href="http://maartenfokkinga.github.io/utwente/mmf92b.pdf">gentle introduction to category theory using the calculational approach</a>; I highly recommend it!
</p>

<p>
Anyhow, in place of strict equality, one uses categorical isomorphism instead.

<p>
Interestingly, we shall later encounter a rather large category named
𝒞𝒶𝓉 possessing the special property of being a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/2-category">“2-Category”</a>:
It has morphisms between objects, as expected, which are now called “1-morphisms”,
and it has morphisms between 1-morphisms, also called “2-morphisms”.
</p>

<p>
That is, it has morphisms between morphisms.
</p>

<p>
Above we argued that equality should be deferred in favour of isomorphism
at the morphism level. Hence, in a 2-Category, it is only reasonable to defer
an equation involving objects to be up to isomorphism of 2-morphisms
&#x2014;this is then called an “equivalence”.
</p>
<pre class="example">
ℒHS ≃ ℛHS  ⇔  Σ F ∶ ℒHS ⟶ ℛHS • Σ G ∶ ℛHS ⟶ ℒHS • F ⨾ G ≅ G ⨾ F ≅ Id
</pre>

<p>
Hence when it comes to categories themselves, one usually speaks in terms of
equivalences rather than isomorphisms.
</p>

<p>
For example, let 𝒫𝒶𝓇 be the supercategory of 𝒮e𝓉 with morphisms being ‘partial
functions’ <code>(A ⟶ B) = (A → B + 𝟙)</code> where the extra element of <code>𝟙 = { * }</code> represents
‘undefined’ &#x2014;also known as the <code>Partial</code>, <code>Option</code>, or <code>Maybe</code> monads.  Moreover,
let 𝒫𝒮ℯ𝓉 be the category of sets with an elected point.  Then, <code>𝒫𝒶𝓇 ≃ 𝒫𝒮e𝓉</code> is
witnessed by <code>(A ⟶ B) ↦ ( (A + 𝟙, *) ⟶ (B + 𝟙, *) )</code> and conversely
<code>( (A , a) ⟶ (B , b) ) ↦ ( A - a ⟶ B - b)</code> where
 <br> <code>X - x ≡ Σ y ∶ X • ¬(x ≡
y)</code>. Exercise: Work out the remaining details for the equivalence.

Sadly, this category is traditionally used to motivate constructions in arbitrary categories
and as such people usually think of objects in an arbitrary category as nothing more than
sets with extra datum &#x2014;which is completely false.
</p>

<p>
For example, the category <code>Div</code> consists of objects <i>and</i> arrows both being numbers ℕ
and there is an arrow \(k : m → n\) precisely when <code>k × m = n</code>, so that an arrow is a
constructive witness that \(m\) divides \(n\). Notice that besides ℕ, no sets nor functions
were involved in the making of this useful number-theoretic category.

Recall that a type, or set, is nothing more than a specified collection of values.
</p>

<p>
Every set is also a category: There is a formal syntactic object associated with each element, the only morphisms are (formal)
identities, and composition is constantly a syntactic identity.
Some define a set to be a category with only identity morphisms; also called a
‘discrete category’ when one wants to distance themself from set theory ;)
&#x2014;less loosely, a discrete category over a type <code>S</code> has <code>Obj = S</code> and <code>(x ⟶ y) = (x ≡ y)</code>,
where the equivalence is classical, having two possible members <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>.
</p>

<p>
Discrete categories are quite an important space for <a href="http://homotopytypetheory.org/">hott</a> people &#x2026;
that’s right, attractive people are interested in these things.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-Categories-are-coherently-preordered-sets">
<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd11xx/EWD1102.PDF">Recall</a> that a preordered set, or preset, is a type <code>P</code> with a relation <code>≤</code> on
it that satisfies <i>indirect inequality from above</i>:
\[
  ∀ x , y •\qquad x ≤ y \quad⇔\quad (∀ z •\; y ≤ z ⇒ x ≤ z)
\]
Equivalently, if it satisfies <i>indirect equality from below</i>:
\[ ∀ x , y •\qquad x ≤ y \quad⇔\quad (∀ z •\; z ≤ x ⇒ z ≤ y) \]
If we also have \(∀ x , y •\; x ≤ y \,∧\, y ≤ x \;⇒\; x = y\),
then we say <code>(P, ≤)</code> is a ‘poset’ or an ‘ordered set’.
</p>

<p>
Every (pre)ordered set is also a category:
The objects are the elements,
the morphisms are the order-relations,
identities are the relfexitivity of <code>≤</code>,
and composition is transitivity of <code>≤</code>.
To see this more clearly, suppose you have a group
\((M, ⊕, \_{}⁻¹, e)\) and you define \(x ≤ y \;⇔\; (∃ m : M •\; m ⊕ x = y)\)
then the this is a preorder whose induced category has a morphism
\(m : x → y\) precicely when \(m ⊕ x = y\)
&#x2013;now sit down and define the remaining categorical structure of this
‘constructive’ preorder associated to the group.
</p>

<p>
Traditionally, classically, the relation <code>≤</code> is precicely a function <code>P × P ⟶ 𝔹 = {true, flase}</code>
and thus there is at-most one morphism between any two objects
&#x2013;consequently, categories with this property are called <i>poset categories</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the constructive setting, the relation <code>≤</code> is typed <code>P × P → Set</code> and then
for a preset <code>(P, ≤)</code> we take <code>Obj = P, _⟶_ = a ≤ b</code> and insist
on ‘proof-irrelevance’ <code>∀ {a b} (p q : a ≤ b) → p ≡ q</code> so that there is at most one morphism
between any two objects.
The restriction is not needed if we were using actual categories-with-setoids since then we would
<i>define</i> morphism equality to be  <br>
<code>((a, b, p) ≈ (a’, b’, q) )  =  (a ≡ a’  ×  b ≡ b’)</code>.
</p>

<p>
Observe that in the case we have a poset, every isomorphism is an equality:
\[
  ∀ x, y •\qquad x ≅ y ⇔ x ≡ y
\]
Categories with this property are called <i>skeletal</i>.
Again, hott people like this; so much so, that they want it, more-or-less, to be a
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4731">foundational axiom</a>!
</p>

<p>
Poset categories are a wonderful and natural motivator for many constructions and definitions in
category theory. This idea is so broad-reaching that it would not be an exaggeration to think of
<a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psarb2/papers/abstract.html#CatTheory">categories as coherently constructive lattices</a>!

Equivalence relations are relations that are symmetric, reflexive, and transitive.
Alternatively, they are preorder categories where every morphism is invertible &#x2014;this is the
symmetry property. But categories whose morphisms are invertible are groupoids!
</p>

<p>
Hence, groupoids can be thought of as generalized equivalence relations.
Better yet, as “constructive” equivalence relations: there might be more than one morphism/construction
witnessing the equivalence of two items.
</p>

<p>
Some insist that a <i>true</i> ‘set’ is a type endowed with an equivalence relation, that is a setoid.
However, since groupoids generalise equivalence relations, others might insist on a true set to be
a "groupoid". However, in the constructive setting of dependent-type theory, these notions
coincide!

It’s been said that the aforementioned categories should be consulted whenever one learns a new

For a functor <code>F</code>, it is common practice to denote both <code>obj F</code> and <code>mor F</code> by <code>F</code> and this is usually
not an issue since we can use type inference to deduce which is meant. However, in the Agda formalization
we will continue to use the names <code>mor , obj</code>. Incidentally in the Haskell community, <code>mor</code>
is known as <code>fmap</code> but we shall avoid that name or risk asymmetry in the definition of
a functor, as is the case in Haskell which turns out to be pragmatically useful.
</p>

<p>
A functor can be thought of as endowing an object with some form of structure
&#x2014;since categories are intrinsically structureless in category theory&#x2014;
and so the morphism component of a functor can be thought of as preserving relations:
<code>f : a ⟶ b ⇒ F f : F a ⟶ F b</code> can be read as, ‘‘if <code>a</code> is related to <code>b</code> (as witnessed by <code>f</code>)
then their structured images are also related (as witness by <code>F f</code>)’’.
Recall the category <code>Div</code> for constructive divisibility relationships ;-)

A functor among monoids &#x2013;construed as categories&#x2013; is just a monoid homomorphism;
i.e., an identity and multiplication preserving function of the carriers.

By induction, <code>h</code> preserves all finite ⊕-multiplication and, more generally,
functors preserve finite compositions:

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A functor among discrete categories is just a function of the associated sets.</li>
<li>A functor among poset categories is an order-preserving function.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Two examples of functors from a poset (category) to a monoid (category):
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><code>monus : (ℕ, ≤) ⟶ (ℕ,+, 0)</code> is a functor defined on morphisms by
\[ i ≤ j \quad⇒\quad \mathsf{monus}(i,j) ≔ j - i\]
Then the functor laws become  <code>i - i = 0</code> and <code>(k - j) + (j - i) = k - i</code>.</li>

<li><code>div : (ℕ⁺, ≤) → (ℚ, ×, 1)</code> is defined on morphisms by
\[i ≤ j \quad⇒\quad \mathsf{div}(i,j) ≔ j / i\]
The functor laws become <code>i / i = 1</code> and <code>(k / j) × (j / i) = k / i</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Hey, these two seem alarmingly similar! What gives!
Well, they’re both functors from posets to monoids ;)
Also, they are instances of ‘residuated po-monoids’.
Non-commutative monoids may have not have a general inverse operation,
but instead might have left- and right- inverse operations known as residuals
&#x2014;we’ll mention this word again when discussing adjunctions and are
categorically seen as kan extensions.
Alternatively, they’re are instances of <a href="http://link.springer.com.libaccess.lib.mcmaster.ca/article/10.1007/s10773-004-7710-7">‘(Kopka) Difference-posets’</a>.
</p>


<p>
For more examples of categories, we will need to reason
by extensionality &#x2013;two things are ‘equal’ when they have
equivalent properties &#x2026; recall Leibniz and his
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_of_indiscernibles">law of indiscernibles</a> ;p

<p>
Categories have objects and morphisms between them, functors are morphisms between categories,
and then we can go up another level and consider morphisms between functors.
These ‘level 2 morphisms’ are pretty cool, so let’s touch on them briefly.
</p>

<p>
Recall that a poset ordering is extended to (possibly non-monotone) functions \(f , g\) pointwise
\[f \overset{.}{≤} g \quad\iff\quad (∀ x •\; f\, x \,≤\, g\, x)\]
As such, with posets as our guide, we extend the notion of ‘morphism between functors’
to be a ‘witness’ of these orderings \(η : ∀ {X} → F\, X ⟶ G\, X\)
&#x2013;this is a dependent type, note that the second arrow notates category morphisms, whereas
the first acts as a separator from the implicit parameter \(X\); sometimes one sees \(η_X\)
for each component/instance of such an operation.
</p>

<div class="org-center">
<p>
\(\require{AMScd}\)
</p>
\begin{CD}
\color{navy}{F\, A} @>\color{fuchsia}{η_A}>>      \color{teal}{G\, A}    \\
@V\color{navy}{F\, f}VV    \!=                    @VV\color{teal}{G\, f}V \\
\color{navy}{F\, B} @>>\color{fuchsia}{η_B}>      \color{teal}{G\, B}
\end{CD}
</div>

<p>
However, then for any morphism \(f : A ⟶ B\) we have two ways to get from \(F\, A\) to \(G\, B\) via
<code>F f ⨾ η {B}</code> and <code>η {A} ⨾ G f</code> and rather than choose one or the other, we request that they
are identical &#x2014;similar to the case of associativity.

<p>
The naturality condition is remembered by placing the target component <code>η {B}</code> <i>after</i>
lifting <code>f</code> using the <i>source</i> functor <code>F</code>;
likewise placing the source component <i>before</i> applying the target functor.
</p>

<p>
Another way to remember it:
<code>η : F ⟶̇ G</code> starts at <code>F</code> and ends at <code>G</code>, so the naturality also starts with <code>F</code> and ends
with <code>G</code>; i.e., <code>F f ⨾ η {B} = η {A} ⨾ G f</code> :-)
</p>

<p>
It is at this junction that aforementioned problem with our definition
of category comes to light: Function equality is extensional by definition
and as such we cannot prove it.
Right now we have two function-like structures for which we will postulate a
form of extensionality,

<p>
With the notions of categories, functors, and extensionality in-hand we can now discus the
notion of the category of small categories and the category of small graphs.
Afterwards we give another example of a functor that says how every category can be
construed as a graph.
</p>

<p>
First the category of <i>smaller</i> categories,
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<code>𝒞𝒶𝓉</code> is a category of kind <code>(ℓsuc m, ℓsuc m)</code>, where <code>m = i ⊍ j</code>, and its objects
are categories of kind <code>(i , j)</code> and so it is not an object of itself.

Some things to note,
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First off: <code>functor F preserves-composition even-under mor G</code> is a real line of code!
It consists of actual function calls and is merely an alias for
<code>≡-cong (mor G) (mor F)</code> but it sure is far more readable than this form!</li>

<li><p>
We could have written <code>id = ≡-cong (mor G) (id F) ⟨≡≡⟩ id G</code>,
but this is not terribly clear what is going on.
Especially since we introduced categories not too long ago,
we choose to elaborate the detail.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, <code>comp = (≡-cong (mor G) (comp F)) ⟨≡≡⟩ (comp G)</code>.
</p></li>

<li><code>assoc</code> is trivial since function composition is, by definition, associative.
Likewise <code>leftId, rightId</code> hold since functional identity is, by definition, unit of function composition.</li>

Let’s formalise what we meant earlier when we said graphs are categories

Likewise, given a functor we ‘forget’ the property that the map of morphisms needs to preserve all
finite compositions to obtain a graph map:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<p>
This says that <code>𝒰₁</code> turns <code>ver, edge</code> into <code>obj , mor</code>
--<code>𝒰₁ ⨾ ver  ≡ obj</code> and <code>𝒰₁ ⨾ edge ≡ mor</code>&#x2013; reassuring us that <code>𝒰₁</code> acts
as a bridge between the graph structures: <code>ver , edge</code> of graphs and
<code>obj , mor</code> of categories.

Putting this together, we obtain a functor.

<p>
We forget about the extra algebraic structure of a category and of a functor to
arrive at a graph and graph-map, clearly --<code>≡-refl</code>&#x2013; such ‘forgetfullness’ preserves identities
and composition since it does not affect them at all!
</p>

<p>
Those familiar with category theory may exclaim that just as I have mentioned
the names ‘underlying functor’ and ‘forgetful functor’ I ought to mention
‘stripping functor’ as it is just as valid since it brings about connotations of
‘stripping away’ extra structure.
I’m assuming the latter is less popular due to its usage for
poor mathematical jokes and puns.
</p>

<p>
Before we move on, the curious might wonder if ‘‘categories are graphs’’
then what is the analgoue to ‘‘\(X\) are hypergraphs’’,
it is <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0305/0305049v1.pdf#page=178">multicategories</a>.
</p>

<p>
Now the remainder of these notes is to build-up the material

<p>
Given two functors \(F , G\), for any object \(~x\) we obtain two objects \(F\, x\, , \, G\, x\) and so a morphism
from \(F\) to \(G\) ought to map such \(F\,x\) to \(G\, x\). That is, a morphsim of functors is a family  <br>
\(η \,:\, ∀ \{x : \Obj 𝒞\} \,→\, F \,x ⟶ G \,x\). Now for any \(f : a → b\) there are two ways to form a morphism
\(F\, a → G\, b\): \(F f ⨾ η \{b\}\) and \(η \{a\} ⨾ G\, f\). Rather than make a choice each time we want such
a morphism, we eliminate the choice all together by insisting that they are identical.
This is the naturality condition.
</p>

<p>
This is similar to when we are given three morphisms \(f : a → b , g : b → c , h : c → d\),
then there are two ways to form a morphism \(a → d\); namely \((f ⨾ g) ⨾ h\) and \(f ⨾ (g ⨾ h)\).
Rather than make a choice each time we want such a morphism, we eliminate the choice all together
by insisting that they are identical. This is the associativity condition for categories.
</p>

<p>
Notice that if there’s no morphism \(F\, x ⟶ G\, x\) for some \(x\), they by definition there’s no
possible natural transformation \(F \natTo G\).

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Natural-means-polymorphic-without-type-inspection">
<p>
A natural transformation can be thought of as a polymorphic function
<code>∀ {X} → F X ⟶ G X</code> <i>where</i> we restrict ourselves to avoid inspecting any <code>X</code>.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Recall that a <code>mono</code>-morphic operation makes no use of type variables in its signature,
whereas a <code>poly</code>-morphic operation uses type variables in its signature.</li>

<li>For example, in C# one can ask if one type <code>is</code> a subclass of another thereby
obtaining specific information, whereas there is no such mechanism in Haskell.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Inspecting type parameters or not leads to the distinction of ad hoc plymorphism vs. parametric
polymorphism &#x2014;the later is the kind of polymorphism employed in functional language like Haskell
and friends and so such functions are natural transformations by default!
<a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/ecen5533/fall11/reading/free.pdf">Theorems for free!</a>
</p>

<p>
For example,
</p>
<pre class="example">
-- Let 𝒦 x y ≔ Id {x} for morphisms, and 𝒦 x y ≔ x for objects.

size : ∀ {X} → List X → 𝒦 ℕ X
size [x₁, …, xₙ] = n
</pre>
<p>
is a polymorphic function and so naturality follows and is easily shown &#x2013;show it dear reader!
So we have always have
\[List\; f \;⨾\; size \quad=\quad size\]
Since <code>𝒦 ℕ f = Id</code>, then by extensionality: <code>size : List ⟶̇ 𝒦</code>.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the polymorphic function
</p>
<pre class="example">
whyme : ∀ {X} → List X → 𝒦 Int X
whyme {X} [x₁,…,xₙ] = If X = ℕ then 1729 else n
</pre>
<p>
is not natural: The needed equation <code>F f ⨾ η {B} = η {A} ⨾ G f</code>
for any <code>f : A → B</code> breaks as witnessed by
<code>f = (λ x → 0) : ℝ → ℕ</code> and any list with length <code>n ≠ 1729</code>,
and this is easily shown &#x2013;do so!
</p>
<p>
One might exclaim, <i>hey! this only works ’cuz you’re using Ramanujan’s taxi-cab number!</i>
<i>1729 is the smallest number expressible as a sum of 2 cubes in 2 ways:</i>
<i>\(1729 = 12³ + 1³ = 10³ + 9 ³\).</i> I assure you that this is not the reason that naturality breaks,
and I commend you on your keen observation.
</p>

<p>
Notice that it is natural if we exclude the type inspected, ℕ.
That is, if we only consider \(f : A → B\) with \(A ≠ ℕ ≠ B\).
In general, is it the case that a transformation can be made natural by excluding
the types that were inspected?
</p>

<p>
Before we move on, observe that a solution in \(h\) to the absorptive-equation \(F f ⨾ h = h\)
is precisely a natural transformation from \(F\) to the aforementioned ‘diagonal functor’:
\[F f ⨾ h \;=\; h \qquad⇔\qquad ∃ X : Obj \;•\; h ∈ F \overset{.}{⟶} 𝒦 X ~\]
</p>

<p>
In particular, due to the constant-fusion property \(g \,⨾\, 𝒦\, e \;=\; 𝒦\, e\), we have that
\[∀ \{F\} \{X\} \{e \,:\, X\} \;→\; (𝒦\, e) \,∈\, F \overset{.}{⟶} 𝒦\, X \]
Is the converse also true? If \(h ∈ F ⟶̇ 𝒦 X\) then \(h \,=\, 𝒦\, e\) for some \(e\)?

<p>
The idea that a natural transformation cannot make reference to the type variable at all can be
seen by yet another example.
</p>

<pre class="example">
  data 𝟙 : Set where ★ : 𝟙

  -- Choice function: For any type X, it yields an argument of that type.
  postulate ε : (X : Set) → X

  nay : ∀ {X} → X → X
  nay {X} _ = ε X
</pre>

<p>
Now naturality \(\Id \, f ⨾ nay_B \;=\; nay_A ⨾ \Id \, f\) breaks as witnessed by
\(f \;=\; (λ _ → εℕ + 1) \;:\; 𝟙 → ℕ\) &#x2013;and provided \(εℕ ≠ 0\), otherwise
we could use an \(f\) with no fix points.
</p>

<p>
From this we may hazard the following:
If we have natural transformations \(ηᵢ \,:\, ∀ {X : Objᵢ} →\, F X \overset{.}{⟶} G X\)
where the \(Objᵢ\) partition the objects available &#x2014; i.e., \(Obj \;=\; Σ i \,•\, Objᵢ\) &#x2014;
then the transformation \(η_{(i, X)} \;=\; ηᵢ\) is generally unnatural since it clearly makes choices,
for each partition.

<p>
The naturality condition can be seen as a rewrite rule that let’s us replace a complicated or
inefficient side with a simplier or more efficient yet equivalent expression.
I think I first learned this view of equations at the insistence of
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Algebra-Programming-Prentice-hall-International-Computer/dp/013507245X">Richard Bird and Oege de Moor</a>
&#x2013;whose text can be found <a href="http://themattchan.com/docs/algprog.pdf">here</a>, albeit the legitimacy of the link may be suspect.
</p>

<p>
For example, recall the 𝒦onstant functor now construed only as a polymorphic binary operation:
</p>
<pre class="example">
_⟪_    :  ∀{A B : Set} → A → B → A
a ⟪ b  =  a
</pre>

<p>
The above is a constant time operation, whereas the next two are linear time operations; i.e.,
they take <code>n</code> steps to compute, where <code>n</code> is the length of the given list.
</p>

<pre class="example">
-- This' map for List's; i.e., the mor of the List functor
map    : ∀ {A B : Set} (f : A → B) → List A → List B
map f []         =  []
map f (x ∷ xs)  =  f x ∷ map f xs

-- Interpret syntax `x₀∷⋯∷xₙ₋₁` semantically as `x₀ ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ xₙ₋₁`, where ⊕ = cons.
fold  : ∀ {A B : Set} (cons : A → B → B) (nil : B) → List A → B
fold cons nil [] = nil
fold cons nil (x ∷ xs) = cons x (fold cons nil xs)
</pre>

<p>
By <i>Theorems for Free</i>, or a simple proof, we have that <code>fold</code> is a natural
transformation \(List \overset{.}{→} \Id\):
\[ List\; f \;⨾\; fold \; cons_B \; nil_B \qquad=\qquad fold \; cons_A \; nil_A \;⨾\; f \]
Note that here we are ranging over objects \(X\) equipped with \(nil_X : X, \; cons_X : X → X → X\);
as such the equation is not valid when this is not the case.
</p>

<p>
Now we map compute,
</p>
<pre class="example">
postulate A B : Set
postulate nil-B : B
postulate f : A → B -- possibly expensive operation

head  :  List B → B
head  =  fold _⟪_ nil-B

compute  :  List A → B
compute  =  map f  ⨾  head
</pre>

<p>
That is,
</p>
<pre class="example">
  compute [x₀, …, xₙ₋₁]
= head (map f [x₀, …, xₙ₋₁])
= head [f x₀, …, f xₙ₋₁]
= f x₀  ⟪  f x₁ ⟪ ⋯ ⟪ ⋯ f xₙ₋₁ ⟪ nil-B
= f x₀
</pre>

<p>
However this approach performs the potentially expensive operation \(f\) a total of
\(n = \text{“length of input”}\) times! In spite of that, it only needs the first element of
the list and performs the operation only once! Indeed, by the naturality of <code>fold</code> we have
an equivalent, and more efficient, formulation:
</p>
<pre class="example">
compute  =  head  ⨾  f
</pre>

<p>
This operation only performs the potentially costly <code>f</code> once!
</p>

<p>
A more concrete and realistic example is to produce an efficient version of the function
that produces the <code>average xs = div (sum xs, length xs)</code> of a list of numbers: This operation
traverses the input list twice, yet we can keep track of the length as we sum-along the list
to obtain an implementation that traverses the list only once!

Let \(𝒰 × 𝒰\) be the functor that for objects \(M \;↦\; 𝒰\, M \,×\, 𝒰\, M\) and for morphisms
\(h \;↦\; λ (x,y) → (h\, x, h\, y)\). Then the monoid multiplication (of each monoid) is a natural
transformation \(𝒰 × 𝒰 \natTo 𝒰\), where naturality says that for any monoid homomorphism \(h\), the
application of \(𝒰\, h\) to the (monoid) multiplication of two elements is the same as the
(monoid) multiplication of the \(𝒰\, h\) images of the two elements,

Extending to finite products, \(ℒ \;≔\; (Σ n ∶ ℕ • ∏ i ∶ 1..n • 𝒰)\), the natural transformation

Recall that \(V(G)\) is essentially \(ℙ₀ ⟶ G\) where
\(ℙₙ\) is the graph of \(n\) edges on \(n+1\) vertices named \(0..n\) with typing \(i \,:\, i-1 ⟶ i\),
which I like to call <i>the path graph of length n</i>; and in particular \(ℙ₀\) is the graph of
just one dot, called 0, and no edges. &#x2014;Earlier I used the notation <code>[n]</code>, but I’m using \(ℙ\) since
I like the view point of ℙaths.
</p>

<p>
What does it mean to say that <i>V(G) is essentially ℙ₀ ⟶ G</i>?
</p>

<p>
It means that the vertices functor
&#x2013; \(𝒱 \;:\; 𝒢𝓇𝒶𝓅𝒽 ⟶ 𝒮ℯ𝓉\) that takes objects \(G ↦ V(G)\) and morphisms \(h ↦ \mathsf{ver}\, h\) &#x2013;
can be ‘represented’ as the Hom functor \((ℙ₀ ⟶ \_{})\), that is to say
\[𝒱 \quad≅\quad (ℙ₀ ⟶ \_{}) \;\mathsf{within \; Func} \; 𝒢𝓇𝒶𝓅𝒽 \; 𝒮ℯ𝓉\]
--<code>Func</code>-tor categories will be defined in the next section!&#x2013;
</p>

<p>
Notice that we arrived at this expression by
‘eta-reducing’ the phrase <i>V(G) is essentially ℙ₀ ⟶ G</i>! ;)
</p>

<p>
More generally, we have the functor \(ℙₙ ⟶ \_{}\) which yields all paths of length \(n\)
for a given graph.
</p>

<p>
Observe &#x2013;i.e., show&#x2013; that we also have an edges functor.

With a notion of morphisms between functors, one is led inexorably to ask
whether functors as objects and natural transformations as morphisms constitute
a category?
They do!
However, we leave their definition to the reader &#x2014;as usual, if the reader is ever so desperate
for solutions, they can be found as comments in the unruliness that is the source file.
</p>
<pre class="example">
 instance
  Func       :  ∀ {i j i’ j’} (𝒞 : Category {i} {j}) (𝒟 : Category {i’} {j’}) → Category _
  Func 𝒞 𝒟  =  {! exercise !}
</pre>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A hint: The identity natural transformation is the obvious way to get from \(F\, X\) to \(F\, X\),
for any \(X\) given \(F\) &#x2014;well the only way to do so, without assuming anything else about the
functor \(F\), is simply \(\Id_{F X}\). This is the ‘natural’ choice, any other choice would be
‘unnatural’ as it would require some ‘cleverness’.</li>

<li>Another hint: The obvious way to define \(η ⨾ γ\) to get \(F\, X ⟶ H\, X\) from
\(F\, X ⟶ G\, X ⟶ H\, X\) is composition of morphisms in the category!
That is, pointwise composition. Nothing ‘clever’, just using the obvious candidates!</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is a good exercise as it will show you that there is an identity functor and that composition of functors
is again a functor. Consequently, functors are in abundance: Given any two, we can form [possibly] new ones by composition.
</p>

<p>
It is a common construction that when a type \(Y\) is endowed with some structure, then we can endow
the function space \(X → Y\), where \(X\) is any type, with the same structure and we do so
‘pointwise’. This idea is formalised by functor categories.
Alternatively, one can say we have ‘categorified’ the idea; where
<i>categorification</i> is the process of replacing types and functions with categories and
functors and possibly adding some coherence laws.
</p>

<p>
There are people who like to make a show about how ‘big’ 𝒞𝒶𝓉 or <code>Func 𝒞 𝓓</code> are;
these people adhere to something called ‘set theory’ which is essentialy type theory but
ignoring types, loosely put they work only with the datatype
</p>
<pre class="example">
data SET : Set where
  Elem : ∀ {A : Set} → A → SET
</pre>
<p>
Such heathens delegate types-of-types into ‘classes’ of ‘small’ and ‘big’ sets and it’s not
uniform enough for me.
Anyhow, such people would say that functor categories ‘‘cannot be constructed (as sets)’’ unless
one of the categories involved is ‘‘small’’. Such shenanigans is ignored due to the hierarchy of
types we are using :-)
</p>

<p>
We must admit that at times the usage of a single type, a ‘uni-typed theory’ if you will can be
used when one wants to relise types in an extrinsic fashion rather than think of data as
intrinsically typed &#x2013;E.g., graphs with <code>src, tgt</code> <i>then</i> deriving a notion of ‘type’ with <code>_⟶_</code>.
Everything has its place &#x2026; nonetheless, I prefer (multi)typed settings!

Let <code>𝟚 ≔ • ⟶ •</code> be the category of two objects, call them 0 and 1, with one arrow between them.

The <i>slice category of 𝒞 over B : Obj 𝒞</i> is the category <code>𝒞 / B ≔ Σ F ∶ Func 𝟚 𝒞 • (F 1 = B)</code>.

<p>
Essentially it is the category of objects being 𝒞-morphisms with target \(B\)
and morphisms \(f ⟶ g\) being \((h,k)\) with \(h ⨾ g = f ⨾ k\) but a natural choice for
\(k : B ⟶ B\) is \(\Id_B\) and so we can use morphism type
\((f ⟶’ g) \;≔\; Σ h : \src f ⟶ \src g \;•\; h ⨾ g = f\).
</p>

<p>
This is seen by the observation \[(h, k) \;∈\; f ⟶ g \qquad⇔\qquad h \;∈\; (f ⨾ k) ⟶’ g\]
Of course a formal justification is obtained by showing
\[\_{}⟶\_{} \quad≅\quad \_{}⟶’\_{} \quad \mathsf{within \; Func }\; (𝒞 ᵒᵖ ⊗ 𝒞) 𝒮e𝓉 \]
&#x2026;which I have not done and so may be spouting gibberish!

Just as the type <code>Σ x ∶ X • P x</code> can be included in the type <code>X</code>, by forgetting the second
component, so too the category <code>Σ F ∶ 𝟚 ⟶ 𝒞 • F 1 ≈ B</code> can be included into the category
𝒞 and we say it is a <i>subcategory</i> of 𝒞.
</p>

<p>
The notation <code>Σ o ∶ Obj 𝒞 • P o</code> defines the subcategory of 𝒞 obtained by deleting
all objects not satisfying predicate <code>P</code> and deleting all morphisms incident to such objects; i.e.,
it is the category 𝒟 with
\[ \Obj 𝒟 \quad≡\quad Σ o ∶ \Obj 𝒞 \,•\, P o
   \qquad\text{ and }\qquad
   (o , prf) ⟶_𝒟 (o' , prf') \quad≡\quad o ⟶_𝒞 o'

This is the largest/best/universal subcategory of 𝒞 whose objects satisfy \(P\).

Where S in the left is construed as a discrete category and in the right

<p>
This is because a functor from a discrete category need only be a function of objects since
there are no non-identity morphisms. That is, a functor \(f : S ⟶ 𝒮ℯ𝓉\)
is determined by giving a set \(f\,s\) for each element \(s ∈ S\) &#x2014;since there are no non-identity morphisms.
Indeed a functor \(f : S ⟶ Set\) yields an <i>S</i>-targeted
function
\[ (Σ s ∶ S \,•\, f\, s) → S  \quad:\quad λ (s , fs) → s \]
Conversely a function \(g : X → S\) yields a functor by sending elements to their pre-image sets:
\[ S ⟶ Set \quad:\quad λ s → (Σ x ∶ X \,•\, g\, x ≡ s)\]

<p>
Because of this example, <code>𝒞 / B</code> can be thought of as ‘𝒞-objects indexed by B’

A functor \(N : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒟 ^ 𝟚\) gives, for each object \(C : \Obj 𝒞\) an object in \(𝒟 ^ 𝟚\) which

that is, a pair of 𝒟-arrows \((F\,f , G\,f) ≔ N\,f\)

Conversely, given a natural transformation \(η : F \overset{.}{⟶} G\)
we define a functor \(N : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒟 ^ 𝟚\) by sending objects \(C\) to \(η_C : F\, C ⟶ G\, C\),
which is an object is \(𝒟 ^ 𝟚\), and sending morphisms \(f : A ⟶ B\) to pairs \((G f , F f)\),
which is a morphism in \(𝒟 ^ 𝟚\) due to naturality of η; namely
\(η_A ⨾ G\, f \;=\; F\, f ⨾ η_B\).
It remains to show that \(N\) preserves identities and composition &#x2013;Exercise!

Now it remains to show that these two processes are inverses
and the isomorphism claim is complete. Woah!

<p>
(Spoilers! Alternatively: <code>Arr (Func 𝒞 𝒟) ≅ 𝟚 ⟶ 𝒞 ^ 𝒟 ≅ 𝒞 × 𝟚 ⟶ 𝒟</code> since <code>𝒞𝒶𝓉</code> has exponentials,
   and so the objects are isomorphic; i.e., natural transformations correspond to functors <code>𝒞×𝟚⟶𝒟</code>)

<p>
Why are we mentioning this alternative statement? Trivia knowledge of-course!
</p>

<p>
On a less relevant note, if you’re familiar with the theory of stretching-without-tearing,
formally known as topology which is pretty awesome, then you might’ve heard of paths and
deformations of paths are known as homotopies which are just continuous functions
\(H : X × I ⟶ Y\) for topological spaces $X, Y,$ and \(I \,=\, [0,1]\) being the unit interval in ℝ.
Letting \(𝒥 = 𝟚\) be the ‘categorical interval’ we have that functors \(𝒞 × 𝒥 ⟶ 𝒟\)
are, by the trivia-relevant result, the same as natural transformations.
That is, <i>natural transformations extend the notion of homotopies, or path-deformations.</i>

On <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/a/75686/42716">mathoverflow</a>, the above is recast succinctly as:

   targeting an arrow category, whose ‘source’
   is \(F\) and whose ‘target’ is \(G\).

It is to be noted that we can define ‘‘graphs over 𝒞’’ to be the category <code>Func 𝒢 𝒞</code>.
Some consequences are as follows: Notion of graph in any category, the notion of graph-map
is the specialisation of natural transformation (!), and most importantly, all the power of functor categories
is avaiable for the study of graphs.
</p>

<p>
In some circles, you may hear people saying an ‘algebra over the signature of graphs’ is an interpretation
domain (<code>𝒞</code>) and an operation (<code>Functor 𝒢 𝒞</code>) interpreting the symbols. <i>Nice!</i>

We briefly take a pause to look at the theory of category theory.
In particular, we show a pair of constructions to get new categories from old ones,
interpret these constructions from the view of previously mentioned categories, and
discuss how to define the morphism type <code>_⟶_</code> on morphisms themselves, thereby
yielding a functor.

The ‘dual’ or ‘opposite’ category 𝒞ᵒᵖ is the category constructed from 𝒞 by
reversing arrows: \((A ⟶_{𝒞ᵒᵖ} B) \;≔\; (B ⟶_𝒞 A)\), then necessarily
\((f ⨾_{𝒞ᵒᵖ} g) \;≔\; g ⨾_𝒞 f\).
A ‘contravariant functor’, or ‘cofunctor’, is a functor F from an opposite category and so
there is a reversal of compositions: \(F(f \,⨾\, g) \;=\; F g \,⨾\, F f\).

Notice that \((𝒞 ᵒᵖ) ᵒᵖ \;=\; 𝒞\) and \(𝒞 ᵒᵖ \;≅\; 𝒞\)
&#x2013;one may have an intuitive idea of what this isomorphsim means,
but formally it is only meaningful in the context of an ambient category; keep reading ;)
</p>

<p>
We must admit that for categories, the notion of isomorphism is considered less useful
than that of equivalence which weakens the condition of the to-from functors being
inverses to just being naturally isomorphic to identities; C.f., ‘evil’ above.

<p>
Indeed, we have <code>g ⨾ f within 𝒞  =  f ∘ g within 𝒞 ᵒᵖ</code>; which is how these composition operators
 are usually related in informal mathematics (without mention of the ambient categories of course).
</p>

<p>
On a more serious note, the opposite of 𝒮e𝓉 is clearly 𝓉ℯ𝒮 haha
&#x2014;technically for the purposes of this pun we identify the words ‘opposite’ and ‘reverse’.
</p></li>

<li>For a discrete category, its opposite is itself.</li>

<li>For a monoid (viewed as a category), its opposite is itself if the monoid operation is commutative, otherwise
it is the ‘dual monoid’.</li>

<li><p>
For a poset (viewed as a category), its opposite is the ‘dual poset’: \((P, ⊑)ᵒᵖ \;=\; (P, ⊒)\).
</p>

<p>
In particular, the ‘least upper bound’, or ‘supremum’ in \((P, ⊑)\) of two elements
\(x,y\) is an element \(s\) with the ‘universal property’: \(∀ z •\; x ⊑ z ∧ y ⊑ z \;≡\; s ⊑ z\).
However, switching ⊑ with ⊒ gives us the notion of ‘infimum’, ‘greatest upper bound’!
So any theorems about supremums automatically hold for infimums since the infifum is nothing
more than the supremum in the dual category of the poset.
</p>

<p>
It is not difficult to see that this idea of “2 for the price of 1” for theorems holds for all
categories.

<code>opify</code> seems to show that <code>Functor 𝒞 𝒟 ≡ Functor (𝒞 ᵒᵖ) (𝒟 ᵒᵖ)</code>, or alternatively a

everything must be made explicit &#x2014;the type system doesn’t let you get away with such things.

Conjecture: Assuming categories are equipped with a contravariant involutionary functor
that is identity on objects, we can show that the identity functor is naturally isomorphic
to the opposite functor.

Some things to note.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Categories whose morphisms are all isomorphisms are called ‘groupoids’ &#x2014;groups are just one-object groupoids.
Consequently, restricted to groupoids the opposite functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor!
</p>

<p>
In fact, the group case was the motivator for me to conjecture the theorem, which took a while to prove since I hadn’t
a clue what I needed to assume. Here we’d use <code>a ˘ ≔ a ⁻¹</code>.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Consider the category <code>Rel</code> whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are ‘typed-relations’ \((S, R, T)\),
where \(R\) is a relation from set \(S\) to set \(T\), and
composition is just relational composition
&#x2014;the notion of ‘untyped’, or multi-typed, morphisms is formalized as pre-categories;
see <a href="http://maartenfokkinga.github.io/utwente/mmf92b.pdf">Fokkinga</a>.
Then we can define an endofunctor by taking <code>-˘</code> to be relational converse: \(x \,(R ˘)\, y \;≡\; y \,R\, x\).
Consequently, restricted to the category <code>Rel</code> we have that the opposite functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity functor.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The above items are instance of a more general concept, of course.
</p>

<p>
A category with an involutionary contravariant endofunctor that is the identity on objects
is known as <i>a dagger category, an involutive/star category, or a category with converse</i>
&#x2014;and the functor is denoted as a superscript suffix by <code>†, *, ˘</code>, respectively.
The dagger notation probably comes from
the Hilbert space setting while the converse notation comes from the relation algebra setting.
As far as I know, the first two names are more widely known.
A dagger category bridges the gap between arbitrary categories and groupoids.
</p>

<p>
Just as matrices with matrix multiplication do not form a monoid but rather a category, we have
that not all matrices are invertible but they all admit transposition and so we have a dagger
category. In the same vein, relations admit converse and so give rise to a category with converse.
</p>

<p>
Besides relations and groupoids, other examples include:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>discrete categories with the dagger being the identity functor</li>
<li>every monoid with an anti-involution is trivially a dagger category; e.g.,
lists with involution being reverse.</li>
<li>commutative monoids are anti-involutive monoids with anti-involution being identity</li>
</ul>

<p>
Spoilers!! Just as the category of categories is carestian closed, so too is the category of dagger
categories and dagger preserving functors &#x2013;c.f.,the <code>respect</code> premise above.

For any two categories 𝒞 and 𝒟 we can construct their ‘product’ category
\(𝒞 ⊗ 𝒟\) whose objects and morphisms are pairs with components from 𝒞 and 𝒟:
\(\Obj\, (𝒞 ⊗ 𝒟) \;\;=\;\; \Obj\, 𝒞 \,×\, \Obj\, 𝒟\) and
\((A , X) ⟶_{𝒞 ⊗ 𝒟} (B , Y) \;\;=\;\; (A ⟶_𝒞 B) \,×\, (X ⟶_𝒟 Y)\).
</p>
<pre class="example">
 -- we cannot overload symbols in Agda and so using ‘⊗’ in-place of more common ‘×’.
 _⊗_ : ∀ {i j i’ j’} → Category {i} {j} → Category {i’} {j’} → Category
 𝒞 ⊗ 𝒟 = {! exercise !}
</pre>
<p>
Observe that in weaker languages, a category is specified by its objects, morphisms, and composition
&#x2014;the proof obligations are delegated to comments, if they are realized at all.
In such settings, one would need to prove that this construction actually produces a full-fledged
category. Even worse, this proof may be a distance away in some documentation.
With dependent types, our proof obligation is nothing more than another component of the program,
a piece of the category type.
</p>

<p>
In a similar fashion we can show that the sum of two categories is again a category and in general
we have the same for quantified variants: <code>Π 𝒞 ∶ Family • 𝒞</code>, likewise for ‘Σ’.
For the empty family, the empty sum yields the category <code>𝟘</code> with no objects and
the empty product yields the category <code>𝟙</code> of one object.
One can then show the usual ‘laws of arithmetic’ &#x2014;i.e., ×,+ form a commutative monoid, up to isomorphism&#x2014;
hold in this setting: Letting <code>★ ∈ {+,×}</code>, we have
associtivity <code>A ★ (B ★ C) ≅ (A ★ B) ★ C</code>, symmetry <code>A ★ B ≅ B ★ A</code>,
unit <code>𝟙 × A ≅ 𝟘 + A ≅ A</code>, and zero <code>𝟘 × A ≅ 𝟘</code>.
These notions can be defined for any category though the objects may or may not exist
&#x2014; in <code>𝒮e𝓉</code> and <code>𝒢𝓇𝒶𝓅𝒽</code>, for example, they do exist ;) &#x2014;and these associated arithmetical
laws also hold.
</p>

<p>
<i>Question!</i> What of the distributivity law,
<code>A × (B + C) ≅ (A × B) + (A × C)</code>, does it hold in the mentioned cases?
Let <code>𝒫𝒮e𝓉</code> be the category of sets with a distinguished point, i.e.,  <code>Σ S : Obj 𝒮e𝓉 • S</code>, and
functions that preserve the ‘point’, one can then show &#x2014;if he or she so desires, and is not
lazy&#x2014; that this category has notions of product and sum but distributivity fails.
</p>

<p>
Some interpretations:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For discrete categories, this is the usual Cartesian product.</li>
<li>For monoid (or poset) categories, this says that the product of two monoids (or posets) is again
a monoid (respectively poset. This follows since the product does not affect the number of
objects and so the product is again a one-object category, i.e., a monoid (poset respectively).</li>
<li>Interestingly, the <i>sum</i> of two monoids is <b>not</b> formed by their disjoint union: Instead
it is the set of all alternating lists of elements from the two given monoids.
Exercise: Find the associated operation ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>
As expected, we have projections,

An example bifunctor is obtained by extending the ‘⟶’ to morphisms:
Given <code>f : A ⟶ B , g : C ⟶ D</code> we define <code>(f ⟶ g) : (B ⟶ C) → (A ⟶ C)</code> by
<code>λ h → f ⨾ h ⨾ g</code> as this is the only way to define it so as to meet the type requirements.

The naming probably comes from the algebra/monoid case where the functors are
monoid <code>hom</code>-omorphisms. Some prefer to use the name <code>Mor</code>, short for <code>mor</code>-phisms,
and that’s cool too. While Haskell programmers might call this the <code>Reader</code> functor.
</p>

<p>
Usual notation for this functor is <code>Hom</code>, but I like Fokkinga’s much better.
He uses <code>(_⟶_)</code> and writes <code>(f ⟶ g) = λ h • f ⨾ h ⨾ g</code>
&#x2014;the first argument of Hom is the first argument of the composition and the last
argument to Hom is the last argument of the resulting composition :-)

<p>
In this section we discuss what it means to be a ‘forgetful functor’?
&#x2013;Also called an `𝒰nderlying functor'.
</p>

<p>
The modifier ‘forgetful’ is meaningful when there’s a notion of extra structure.
Indeed any functor <i>F : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒮</i> can be thought of as forgetful by construing the objects of
𝒞 as objects of 𝒮 with extra structure.
Mostly: <i>You know it (to be forgetful) when you see it!</i>
</p>

<h3 id="Being-forgetful-from-injections-to-faithful-functors"><span class="section-number-3">9.1</span> Being forgetful: from injections to faithful functors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Being-forgetful-from-injections-to-faithful-functors">
<p>
A common example from set theory is the ‘inclusion’ of a subset \(A\) of \(B\), the injection
\(ι : A ↪ B : a ↦ a\) &#x2014;it is essentially a form of ‘type casting’: \(a ∈ A\) and \(ι a \;=\; a ∈ B\).
Such injections ‘forget’ the property that the argument is actually a member of a specified
subset. Indeed, construing sets as categories then functions becomes functors and inclusions
are then forgetful functors!
</p>

<p>
Since a functor <i>F</i> consists of two maps <i>(F₀, F₁) ≔ (obj F, mor F)</i> and some properties, we can speak about properties of the
functor and about properties of either of its maps.
The common definitions are a functor \(F\) is:
</p>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>faithful</dt><dd>If its operation on morphisms is <i>injective</i>, and it is</dd>
<dt>full    </dt><dd>If morphisms starting and ending at <i>F</i> are a result of applying \(F\);  <br>
i.e., <i>F₁</i> is surjective <i>on</i> the image of <i>F₀</i>:  <br>
\(∀ x,y ∶ Obj \;•\; ∀ g ∶ F₀ x ⟶ F₀ y \;•\; ∃ f ∶ x ⟶ y \;•\; F₁ f = g\).</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Now we can generalize the previous example.
Every faithful functor <i>F : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒟</i> can be construed as forgetful:
The 𝒞-maps can be embedded into the 𝒟-maps, since F is faithful, and so can be thought of
as a special sub-collection of the 𝒟-maps; then \(F\) ‘forgets’ the property of being in this
special sub-collection.
</p>

<p>
Are faithful functors in abundance? Well any functor forgetting only axioms
(and/or structure) is faithful:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Suppose 𝒞 consists of 𝒟 objects satisfying some axioms and 𝒟 maps preserving this structure.</li>
<li>That is, 𝒞 has pairs of 𝒟 objects/morphisms with a proof that it satisfies the axioms/preserves-structure.</li>
<li>Then “\(F : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒟\) forgets only axioms” means \(F\, (f, \mathsf{proof}) \;=\; f\).</li>
<li><p>
Now given, \(F (f , prf) = F (g , prf) \;⇔\; f = g \;⇔\; (f , prf) = (g , prf)\)
&#x2013; equality does not (extensionally) depend on proof components.
</p>

<p>
Hence, faithful :-)
</p>

<p>
(Likewise for forgetting extra structure).
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Of course we’re not saying all forgetful functors are necessarily faithful.
A simple counterexample is the absolute value function:
Given a real number \(x\) it’s absolute value \(∣x∣\) is obtained by totally ignoring its sign
&#x2014;of course \(x\) and \(∣x∣\) are equidistant from 0, the relation equidistant-from-0 is an equivalence
relation &#x2013;Exercise!&#x2013;, and so the the two are isomorphic in some sense.
</p>

<p>
Motivated by this, given a set \(S\) it’s size is denoted \(∣ S ∣\) which totally forgets about the
elements of the set &#x2014;of course it can be shown that two sets are isomorphic precisely if they are
equinumerous.
</p>

<p>
I assume it is with these as motivators, some people write \(∣·∣\) for a forgetful functor.
</p>

<p>
( Exercise: A functor <code>F : 𝒞 ≃ 𝒟</code> is (part of) an equivalence iff it is full,
faithful, and ‘‘essentially surjective on objects’’:
 <code>∀ D : Obj 𝒟 • Σ C : Obj 𝒞 • F C ≅ D</code> &#x2014;note the iso. )

<h3 id="Of-basis-vectors"><span class="section-number-3">9.2</span> Of basis vectors</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Of-basis-vectors">
<p>
If you’ve ever studied abstract algebra &#x2014;the math with vector spaces&#x2014; then you may recall that
a collection of vectors ℬ is called a ‘basis’ if every vector can be written as a linear
combination of these vectors: For any vector \(v\), there are scalars \(c₁, …, cₙ\) and vectors
\(b₁, …, bₙ\) in ℬ with \(v \;=\; c₁·b₁ + ⋯ + cₙ·bₙ\). That is, a basis is a collection of ‘building
blocks’ for the vector space. Then any function \(f\) between basis sets immediately lifts to a
linear transformation (think vector space morphism) \(F\) as follows: Given a vector \(v\), since we
have a basis, we can express it as \(c₁·b₁ + ⋯ + cₙ·bₙ\), now define
\(F v \;≔\; c₁·(f\, b₁) + ⋯ + cₙ·(f\, bₙ)\).
</p>

<p>
Sweet!
</p>

<p>
Thus, to define a complicated linear transformation of vector
spaces, it more than suffices to define a plain old simple function of basis sets.
Moreover, by definition, such \(F\) maps basis vectors to basis vectors: \(f \;=\; ι ⨾ F\) where
\(ι : ℬ ↪ 𝒱\) is the inclusion that realises basis vectors as just usual vectors in the vector
space 𝒱.  <b>Slogan:</b>
<i>Vector space maps are determined by where they send their basis, and basis-vectors
are preserved.</i>
</p>

<p>
In the case of <code>(List A, ++, [])</code> we may consider <code>A</code> to be a ‘basis’ of the monoid &#x2014;indeed,
every list can be written as a linear combination of elements of <code>A</code>, given list
<code>[x₁, …, xₙ] : List A</code> we have <code>[x₁, …, xₙ] = x₁ + ⋯ + xₙ</code> where <code>x + y ≔ [x] ++ [y]</code>.
Reasoning similarly as above, or if you have familiarity with <code>foldr , reduce</code>, we have a <b>slogan:</b>
<i>Monoid homomorphisms from lists are determined by where they send their basis and basis-vectors are preserved.</i>
</p>

<p>
Now the general case: <i>\(F ⊣ U\) is a (free-forgetful) ‘adjunction’</i> means
for functors ‘forget’ \(U : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒮\) and ‘free’ \(F : 𝒮 → 𝒞\), we have that
for a given 𝒮imple-object \(S\) there’s 𝒮imple-map \(ι : S ⟶_𝒮 U\,(F\, S)\) &#x2014;a way to realise ‘basis
vectors’&#x2014; such that for any 𝒞omplicated-object \(C\) and 𝒮imple-maps \(φ : S ⟶_𝒮 U\, C\), there is a
unique 𝒞omplicated-map \(Φ : F\, S ⟶_𝒞 C\) that preserves the basis vectors: \(φ = ι ⨾ U Φ\).
</p>

<p>
By analogy to the previous two cases, we may
consider \(U\, X\) to be a ‘basis’, and make the <b>slogan</b>:
𝒞omplicated-maps from free objects are
determined by where they send their basis and ‘basis vectors’ are preserved.
</p>

<p>
[ In more categorical lingo, one says \(ι\) is the ‘insertion of generators’.
</p>

<p>
  Question: Does the way we took \(ι\) in the previous graph show that it is a natural
  transformation \(ι : \Id ⟶ F ⨾ U\)?
  &#x2014;The naturality just says that a ‘homomorphism’ \(F f\) on the free object is
  completely determined by what \(f\) does to the generators ;-)

<p>
An adjunction \(L ⊣ U\), where the <code>L</code>-ower adjoint is from 𝒮 to 𝒞 and the <code>U</code>-pper adjoint is in
the opposite direction, lends itself to an elemntary interpretation if we consider 𝒞
to be some universe of 𝒞omplicated items of study, while 𝒮 to be a universe of 𝒮imple
items of study. Then adjointness implies that given a simple-object \(S\) and a complicated-object
\(C\), a simple-map \(X ⟶ U\, C\) corresponds to a complicated-map \(L\, S ⟶ C\). To work with
complicated-maps it is more than enough to work with simple-maps!
</p>

<p>
Formally this correspondence, saying \(F : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒟\) is adjoint to \(G : 𝒟 ⟶ 𝒞\), written \(F ⊣ G\),
holds precisely when \((F ∘ X ⟶ Y) \;≅\; (X ⟶ G ∘ Y)\) in a functor category:

<p>
This is easier for verifying an adjunction, while the former is easier for remembering and understanding what an adjunction actually is.
</p>

<p>
As the slogan goes ‘adjunctions are everywhere’.
They can be said to capture the notions of optimization and efficiency, but also that of simplicity.
</p>

<p>
For example, the supremum of a function is defined to be an upper bound of its image set and the least such bound.
Formally, this definition carries a few quantifiers and so a bit lengthy.
More elegantly, we can say the supremum operation is left-adjoint to the constant function: \[ \mathsf{sup} ⊣ 𝒦 \]
which means \[ ∀ z •\qquad \mathsf{sup}\, f \,≤\, z \quad⇔\quad f \overset{.}{≤} 𝒦\, z\]
Where \(𝒦\, x\, y \,=\, x\) and the \(\overset{.}{≤}\) on the right is the point-wise ordering on functions.
This formulation of supremum is not only shorter to write but easier to use in calculational proofs.
</p>

<p>
For the efficiency bit, recall that it is efficient to specify a 𝒮imple-map, then use the adjuction, to obtain
a 𝒞omplicated-map. Recall in the last paragraph how we define the super complicated notion of supremum of a function
in terms of the most elementary constant function!
</p>

<p>
Adjunctions over poset categories are called ‘Galois connections’ and a good wealth of
material on them can be found in nearly any writing by <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psarb2/papers/papers.html">Backhouse et. al.</a>,
while a very accessible introduction is by <a href="http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~psarb2/MPC/galois.ps.gz">Aarts</a>,
and there is also an Agda mechanisation by <a href="http://relmics.mcmaster.ca/RATH-Agda/AContext-2.1.pdf">Kahl &amp; Al-hassy</a>.
</p>

<p>
Regarding forgetful functors:
Generally, but not always, forgetful functors are faithful and have left adjoints
&#x2014;because the notion of ‘forget’ ought to have a corresponding notion of ‘free’.
An exception to this is the category of fields, which has a forgetful functor to the
category of sets with no left adjoint.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Adjunctions-and-Representable-Functors">
<p>
Another awesome thing about adjunctions <code>L ⊣ U</code> is that they give us ‘representable functors’,
  a.k.a. ‘the best kind of functors’, when terminal objects exist.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An object <code>𝟙</code> is ‘terminal’ if for any object <code>A</code> there is a unique morphism <code>! {A} : A ⟶ 𝟙</code>.
In 𝒮ℯ𝓉 we have <code>(A ⟶ 𝟙) ≅ 𝟙</code> and <code>(𝟙 ⟶ A) ≅ A</code>.</li>

<li>Specialising the adjunction, where <code>U : 𝒞 ⟶ 𝒮e𝓉</code>, to
a given set <code>A</code> and <code>𝟙</code> we obtain <code>(L 𝟙 ⟶ A) ≅ (𝟙 ⟶ U A) ≅ U A</code> and so one says
‘ <code>U</code> is represented by <code>L 𝟙</code> ’.</li>

<li>In particular, if 𝒞 is built on 𝒮ℯ𝓉 by adding some structure
and we are interested in utilising the elements of an object <code>A</code>
then it suffices to utilise the maps <code>L 𝟙 ⟶ A</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the case of a free-forgetful adjunction, this says that
  <i>a forgetful functor is represented by the free object with generator <code>𝟙</code>.</i>
</p>

<p>
For example, for monoids the one-point monoid is the terminal object: <code>𝟙 ≔ ({*}, ⊕, *)</code> with <code>x ⊕ y ≔ ⋆</code>.
Then every monoid-homomorphism from <code>𝟙</code> just picks out an element of the carrier of a monoid and so
<code>(𝟙 ⟶ M) ≅ 𝒰 M</code> where <code>𝒰</code> is the forgetful functor for monoids mentioned in the introduction.

<p>
A final note about ‘free objects’ &#x2014;arising from an adjoint to a forgetful functor.
</p>

<p>
<b>‘‘The free object is generic’’</b>: The only truths provable for the free
object are precisely those that hold for every complicated-object.
</p>

<p>
(Begin squinting eyes)
 <br>
This follows from the
definition of adjunction which says we can construct a unique morphism between complicated-objects
from a simple-map and by naturality we may transport any proof for the free object to any
complicated object.

For futher reading consider reading the adjoint article at <a href="http://www.comicbooklibrary.org/articles/Left_adjoint">the comic book library</a>

<p>
You might be asking,
 <i>musa, when am I ever going to encounter this in daily life? In a popular setting?</i>
This concept is everywhere, even inclusions as mentioned earlier are an
instance. For the second question, enjoy listening to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BipvGD-LCjU">this lovely musical group</a> &#x2013;they use the words ‘forgetful functors’ ;)

<i>The “right” definition is hard to obtain!</i>

<p>
We can now define a ‘path’ of length <code>n</code> in a graph <code>G</code> to be a graph-map
<code>[ n ] ⟶ G</code>.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell"><span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">Path</span>&#8320; <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">:</span> <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">&#8469;</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">Graph</span>&#8320; <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">Set</span> (&#8467;suc &#8467;&#8320;)
<span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">Path</span>&#8320; n <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">G</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">=</span> [ n ]&#8320; <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">&#119970;</span><span style="color: #268bd2;">&#10230;</span>&#8320; <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">G</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Unfolding the definition of graph-morphisms, this just says that a path of length <code>n</code>
consists of a sequence <code>[v₀, v₁, v₂,  …, vₙ]</code> of vertices of <code>G</code> and a sequence <code>[e₀, e₁, …, eₙ₋₁]</code>
of edges of <code>G</code> with typing <code>eᵢ : vᵢ ⟶ vᵢ₊₁</code>.
</p>

<p>
The definition is pretty slick! However, as the name suggests, perhaps we can concatenate paths
and it’s not at all clear how to do this for the vertex- and edge- morphisms of the graph-maps
involved, whereas it’s immediately clear how to do this with sequences: We just concatenate the
sequences and ensure the result is coherent.
</p>

<p>
Since the vertices can be obtained from the edges via <code>src</code> and <code>tgt</code>, we can dispense with them
and use the definition as outlined above.

</pre>
</div>
<p>
That is, edges <code>[e₀, …, eₙ]</code> with coherency <code>tgt eᵢ ≡ src eᵢ₊₁</code>.
</p>

<p>
Great, we’ve cut the definition of <code>Path₀</code> in half but that fact that we get a raw list of edges
and then need coherency to ensure that it is a well-formed path is still not terribly lovely.
After all, we’re in Agda, we’re among kings, we should be able to form the list in such a way that
the end result is a path. Let’s do that!
</p>

<p>
Enough of this repetition, let us fix a graph <code>G</code>,

<p>
This seems great, but there’s always room for improvement:
</p>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
Since the <code>cons</code> constructor's third argument depends on its first, we must
use a syntax declaration to get the desired look. Such aesthetic is not only
pleasing but reminiscent of diagrammatic paths;
moreover, it’s guaranteed to be an actual path and not just an
alternating lists of vertices and edges.
Using the clunky <code>Path₂</code>, we’d write
</p>
<pre class="example">
  v₁ ⟶[ v₁≈se₁ , e₁ , te₁≈v₂ ]⟶ v₂ ⟶[ v₂≈se₂ , e₂ , te₂≈v₃ ]⟶ v₃ !
  where
  syntax cons v e ps s t = v ⟶[ s , e , t ]⟶ ps
</pre>
<p>
yuck!
</p>

<p>
Finally, the syntax-declaration does not make the emacs agda-mode auto-case using
the syntax, and so I have to write it out by hand, each time I want to use the syntax.
</p></li>

<li>Again since <code>cons</code>'s third argument depends on the second argument, we need a mutual
definition to extract the item of the dependence. Perhaps if we embed this item at
the type level we may avoid the need of an auxiliary mutually-defined function.</li>

<li>By defining what the start and finish of a path are, we can assign types to it.
However, this approach is reminiscent of the parallel-pair approach to graphs,
as in <code>Graph₀</code>, which we argued is less preferable to the typed-approach to graphs.
Perhaps defining paths with types by default, we can reap the benefits and simplicity
of the typed-approach to graphs.</li>

One might think that since we can write
</p>
<pre class="example">
  src : {x y : V G} (e : x ⟶ y) → V G
  src {x} {y} e = x
</pre>
<p>
we can again ignore vertices and it suffices to just keep a coherent list of edges.
Then what is an empty path at a vertex? This’ enough to keep vertices around
&#x2014;moreover, the ensuing terms look like diagrammatic paths! Cool!

With paths in hand, we can now consider a neat sequence of <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1640298/coforgetful-functors">exercises</a> :-)
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
Show that graphmaps preserve paths: <code>(f : G ⟶ H)  → x ⇝ y → fᵥ x ⇝ fᵥ y</code>;
this is nothing more than type-preservation for <code>f</code> to be a functor <code>𝒫G ⟶ 𝒫H</code> ;)
</p>

<p>
Hint: This is <code>lift</code> from the next section.
</p></li>

<li><p>
Define
</p>
<pre class="example">
a connected b  ≡  (a ⇝ b) ⊎ (b ⇝ a)  --  path “between” a and b; not ‘from a to b’.
</pre></li>

<li>This is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are called <i>the connected components of G</i>;
denote them by <code>𝒦G</code>.</li>

<li>For any category <code>𝒞</code>, define <code>𝒦 𝒞 ≔ 𝒦 (𝒰₀ 𝒞)</code> which is a subcategory of <code>𝒞</code>.</li>

<li>Phrase the connected components subcategory using a universal property,
thereby avoiding the need for quotient types.</li>

<li>Since graphmaps preserve paths, every graph map can be extended to connected components,
<code>𝒦f : 𝒦G ⟶ 𝒦H : (connected component of x) ↦ (connected component of fᵥ x)</code>.</li>

<li>Hence, we have a functor <code>𝒦 : Graph ⟶ Set</code>.</li>

<li><p>
Then there is a natural transformation <code>𝒱 ⟶ 𝒦</code>, where 𝒱 is the vertices functor.
</p>

<p>
Hint: Such a transformation means we can realise vertices as connected components and this suggests
taking assigning a vertex to the connected-component block that contains it.
</p>

<p>
yeah!
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Finally, if we let <code>𝒟 : 𝒮ℯ𝓉 → 𝒞𝒶𝓉</code> be the free category functor that associates each set with
the discrete category over it, then we have <code>𝒦</code> is the associated forgetful functor.

<p>
Notice that the the base case indicate that <code>!</code> forms a left-unit for <code>++</code>,
while the inductive case says that path-formation associates with path catenation.
Both observations also hold for the definition of list catenation ;-)
</p>

<p>
If we had not typed our paths, as in <code>Path₂</code>, we would need to carry around a
proof that paths are compatible for concatenation:
</p>
<pre class="example">
  catenate : (p q : Path) (coh : end p ≡ head q) → Path
  syntax catenate p q compatibility = p ++[ compatibility ] q
</pre>
<p>
Even worse, to show <code>p ++[ coh ] q ≡ p ++[ coh’ ] q</code> we need to invoke proof-irrelevance of
identity proofs to obtain <code>coh ≡ coh’</code>, each time we want such an equality! Moving the proof
obligation to the type level removes this need.
</p>

<p>
As can be seen, being type-less is a terrible ordeal.
</p>

<p>

<p>
Can we make <code>𝒫</code> into a functor by defining it on morphisms?
That is, to lift graph-maps to category-maps, i.e., functors.

<p>
Recall why lists give the ‘free monoid’: We can embed a type \(A\) into \(\List A\) by the map \([\_{}]\),
and we can lift any map \(f : A ⟶ B\) to a monoid map
\[\foldr \; (λ a b → f\, a ⊕ b)\; e \;:\; (\List A ,\_{}++\_{} , []) \,⟶\, (B,\_{}⊕\_{} , e)\]
I.e., \([a₁, …, aₖ] \;↦\; f\, a₁ ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ f\, aₖ\). Moreover
this ‘preserves the basis’ \(A\)
&#x2013; i.e., \(∀ a •\; f\, a \,=\, \foldr \,f \,e \, [ a ]\) &#x2013;
and this lifted map is unique.
</p>

<p>
Likewise, let us show that \(𝒫G\) is the ‘free category’ over the graph \(G\).
This amounts to saying that there is a way, a graph-map, say \(ι\), that embeds \(G\) into \(𝒫G\),
and a way to lift any graph-map \(f \,:\, G \,𝒢⟶\, 𝒰₀ 𝒞\) to a functor \(\mathsf{lift}\, f : 𝒫G ⟶ 𝒞\)
that ‘preserves the basis’ \(f \;=\; ι ⨾ 𝒰₁ (\mathsf{lift}\, f)\) and uniquely so.

<p>
Given a graph map \(f\), following the list-analagoue of \([a₁, …, aₖ] \;↦\; f\, a₁ ⊕ ⋯ ⊕ f\, aₖ\)
we attempt to lift the map onto paths by taking the edges \(e₁, …, eₖ\) of a path
to a morphism \(\edge\, f\, e₁ ⨾ ⋯ ⨾ \edge\, f\, eₖ\).
That is, a path of the form
\[x_0 \xrightarrow{e_1} x_1 \xrightarrow{e_2} x_2 \xrightarrow{e_3} ⋯ \xrightarrow{e_k} x_k \]
Is lifted to the composition of morphisms
\[\mathsf{ver}\, f\, x_0 \xrightarrow{\edge\, f\, e_1}
   \mathsf{ver}\, f\, x_1 \xrightarrow{\edge\, f\, e_2}
   \mathsf{ver}\, f\, x_2 \xrightarrow{\edge\, f\, e_3} ⋯ \xrightarrow{\edge\, f\, e_k}
   \mathsf{ver}\, f\, x_k \]
</p>

<p>
Of course, we then need to verify that this construction is indeed
functorial.

‘preserves basis’ property holds as does uniqueness.

Observe that we simply chased definitions and as such <code>graphmapext ≡-refl rightId</code> suffices as a proof,
but it’s not terribly clear why, for human consumption, and so we choose to elaborate with the
detail.

<p>
Finally, it remains to show that there is a unique way to preserve ‘basis’:

Challenge:
Define graph-map equality ‘≈g’ by <i>extensionality</i> &#x2013;two graph maps are equal iff
their vertex <i>and</i> edge maps are extensionally equal. This is far more relaxed
than using propositional equality ‘≡’. Now show the stronger uniqueness claim:
</p>
<pre class="example">
∀{f : G ⟶ 𝒰₀ 𝒞} {F : 𝒫₀ G ⟶ 𝒞}   →   f  ≈g  (ι ⨾ 𝒰₁ F)   →   lift f  ≡  F
</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="Another-freedom-proof"><span class="section-number-3">11.3</span> Another freedom proof</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-Another-freedom-proof">
<p>
However, saying each graph-map gives rise to exactly one unique functor is tantamount to
saying the type <code>GraphMap G (𝒰₀ 𝒞)</code> is isomorphic to <code>Functor (𝒫₀ G) 𝒞</code>, that is
<code>(𝒫₀ G ⟶ 𝒞) ≅ (G ⟶ 𝒰₀ 𝒞)</code> &#x2014;observe that this says we can ‘move’ <code>𝒫₀</code> from the left to
the right of an arrow at the cost of it (and the arrow) changing.
</p>

<p>
A few healthy exercises,
</p>

<pre class="example">
  lift˘ : Functor 𝒫G 𝒞 → GraphMap G (𝒰₀ 𝒞)
  lift˘ F = ι ⨾g 𝒰₁ F  --  i.e., record {ver = obj F , edge = mor F ∘ edge ι}

  rid : ∀{f : GraphMap G (𝒰₀ 𝒞)} → ∀{x y} {e : x ⟶g y} → lift˘ (lift f) ≡ f
  rid = {! exercise !}

  lid : ∀{F : Functor 𝒫G 𝒞} → lift (lift˘ F) ≡ F
  lid = {! exercise !}
</pre>

<p>
One can of course obtain these proofs from the other ones without recourse to definitions,
however for comprehension one would do well to prove them from first principles.
The worked out solutions are available in the literate source file of this document.
</p>

<p>
We can then provide an alternative, and more succinct, proof of uniqueness for ‘basis preservation’:

<div id="outline-container-org040c202" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-𝒫-𝒰">
<p>
Thus far, we have essentially shown
\[(𝒫₀\, G \,⟶\, 𝒞) \quad≅\quad (G \,⟶\, 𝒰₀\, 𝒞)\]
We did so by finding a pair of inverse maps:
</p>

<pre class="example">
lift   :  (    G ⟶ 𝒰₀ 𝒞)  →  (𝒫₀ G ⟶     𝒞)
lift˘  :  (𝒫₀ G  ⟶    𝒞)  →  (   G ⟶  𝒰₀ 𝒞)
</pre>

<p>
This is nearly <code>𝒫 ⊣ 𝒰</code> which implies <code>𝒫</code> is a ‘free-functor’ since it is left-adjoint to a forgetful-functor.
</p>

<p>
‘Nearly’ since we need to exhibit naturality:
For every graph map <code>g</code> and functors <code>F, k</code> we have
<code>lift˘ (𝒫 g ⨾ k ⨾ F) ≈ g ⨾ lift˘ k ⨾ 𝒰 F</code> in the category of graphs.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://maartenfokkinga.github.io/utwente/mmf92b.pdf">Fokkinga (Theorem A.4)</a>, among others, would call these laws ‘fusion’
instead since they inform us how to compose, or ‘fuse’, a morphism with a
<code>lift˘</code>-ed morphism: Taking <code>F</code> to be the identity and remembering that functors preserve
identities, we have that <code>g ⨾ lift˘ K ≡ lift˘( 𝒫₁ g ⨾ K)</code> &#x2013;we can push a morphism into a <code>lift˘</code>
at the cost of introducing a <code>𝒫₁</code>; dually for <code>lift</code>-ed morphisms.

<p>
Generalising on <code>length</code>, suppose we have a ‘cost function’ <code>c</code> that assigns a cost of traversing
an edge. Then we can ask what is the total cost of a path:
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-haskell">  path<span style="color: #268bd2;">-</span>cost <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">:</span> (c <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">:</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8704;</span>{x y}(e <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">:</span> x <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#10230;</span> y) <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">&#8469;</span>) <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8704;</span>{x y}(ps <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">:</span> x <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8669;</span> y) <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> <span style="color: #b58900; font-style: italic;">&#8469;</span>
  path<span style="color: #268bd2;">-</span>cost c <span style="color: #268bd2;">=</span> fold (&#955; <span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">_</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> 0)           <span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">-- </span><span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">No cost on an empty path.</span>
                     (&#955; x e n <span style="color: #268bd2;">&#8594;</span> c e <span style="color: #268bd2;">+</span> n) <span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">-- </span><span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">Cost of current edge plus</span>
                                          <span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">-- </span><span style="color: #96A7A9; font-style: italic;">cost of remainder of path.</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
Now, we have <code>length = path-cost (λ _ → 1)</code>: Length is just assigning a cost of 1 to each edge.
</p>

<p>
Under suitable conditions, list fold distributes over list catenation, can we find an analogue
for paths? Yes. Yes, we can:

How do we interpret a list over \(A\) as a graph?
Well the vertices can be any element of \(A\)
and an edge \(x ⟶ y\) merely indicates that
‘‘the item after \(x\) in the list is the element \(y\)’’,
so we want it to be always true; or always inhabited
without distinction of the inhabitant:
So we might as well use a unit type.

I haven’t a clue if this works, you read my reasoning above.

<p>
The only thing we can do is test our hypothesis by looking at the
typed paths over this graph. In particular, we attempt to show every
non-empty list of \(A\)’s corresponds to a path. Since a typed path needs
a priori the start and end vertes, let us construe
<code>List A  ≅  Σ n ∶ ℕ • Fin n → A</code>
&#x2013;later note that <code>Path G  ≅  Σ n ∶ ℕ • [n] 𝒢⟶ G</code>.

<p>
These few adventures would suggest that much of list theory can be
brought over to the world of paths. It looks promising, let me know
dear reader if you make progress on related explorations!

<p>
Lessons learned:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In Agda, Use implicits when possible in-favour of instance variables
since the former can be inferred from the local context,
whereas the latter must be resolved using the entire global context
thereby incurring possibly more unification problems to solve
thereby costing more time.</li>

<li>If you really want to learn something, teach it to someone:
A proof assistant wont let you get away with skipping over anything!</li>

<li>Coming up with the right data representation for the tasks being tackled
is a matter of discovery!</li>
</ul>

<p>
The astute reader may have noticed that the tone of writing sometimes
changes drastically. This is because some of this article was written
by me in March 2016 and I wished to preserve interesting writing style
I then had &#x2013;if anything to contrast with my now somewhat semi-formal style.
</p>

<p>
This article was motivated while I was reading <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Conceptual-Mathematics-First-Introduction-Categories/dp/052171916X">Conceptual Mathematics</a>
for fun. One of the problems was to show that paths over a graph form
a category and do so freely. It took me about 20 minutes on paper and pencil,
but this resulting mechanisation took much more time &#x2013;but it was also
much more fun!
</p>

<p>
I had fun writing this up &amp; I hope you enjoy it too :-)

<p>
We do not want the MathJax declarations to use vertical whitespace;
so we do not display their residual whitespace.
</p>

<p>
Moreover the form of MathJax declarations differs from usual LaTeX
declarations, so we iffalse&#x2026;fi these ones.
</p>

<p>
Commenting the MathJax using &lt;!&#x2013; HTML comments &#x2013;&gt;
makes the commands inaccessible elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
The alternative is to declare a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1992114/how-do-you-create-a-hidden-div-that-doesnt-create-a-line-break-or-horizontal-sp">non-displayed ~div</a>~.

\[\newcommand{\step}[1]{ \\ = \;\; & \qquad \color{maroon}{⟨ \text{ #1 } ⟩} \\ & }\]
\[\newcommand{\stepWith}[2]{ \\ #1 \;\; & \qquad \color{maroon}{⟨ \text{ #2 } ⟩} \\ & }\]
\[\newenvironment{calc}{\begin{align*} & }{\end{align*}}\]
</p>

<p>
Having identical label references for different equations will break rendering!
</p>

<p>
eqn            := display name, then display formula.
eqnColour      := display name, then display formula, then colour
eqnLabel       := display name, then display formula, then label
eqnLabelColour := display name, then display formula, then label, then colour
eqnLabelColour := display name, then display formula, then colour, then label &#x2013; safe redundancy!
</p>

<p>
\[\newcommand{\eqnLabelColour}[4]{ \begin{equation} \color{#4}{#2} \label{#3}\tag{$\color{#4}{\text{#1}}$} \end{equation} }\]
</p>

<p>
\[\newcommand{\eqnColourLabel}[4]{ \eqnLabelColour{#1}{#2}{#4}{#3} }\]
</p>

<p>
Default equation colour is: navy
\[\newcommand{\eqnLabel}[3]{ \eqnLabelColour{#1}{#2}{#3}{navy} }\]
</p>

<p>
Default label is the display name
\[\newcommand{\eqnColour}[3]{ \eqnLabelColour{#1}{#2}{#1}{#3} }\]
</p>

<p>
\[\newcommand{\eqn}[2]{ \eqnLabel{#1}{#2}{#1} }\]
</p>

<p>
Notice that \ref{Label} and \ref{Label2} have the same displayed name,
but <b>cannot</b> have the same label!
</p>

<p>
\[\newcommand{\givens}[1]{ \color{teal}{#1} }\]
\[\newcommand{\requireds}[1]{ \color{navy}{#1} }\]
</p>

<p>
\[\def\lands{\;\land\;}\]
\[\def\landS{\quad\land\quad}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\def\impliess{\;\Rightarrow\;}\]
\[\def\impliesS{\quad\Rightarrow\quad}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\def\equivs{\;\equiv\;}\]
\[\def\equivS{\quad\equiv\quad}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\def\eqs{\;=\;}\]
\[\def\eqS{\quad=\quad}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\def\sqleqs{\;\sqsubseteq\;}\]
\[\def\sqleqS{\quad\sqsubseteq\quad}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\def\foldr{\mathsf{foldr}}\]
\[\def\edge{\mathsf{edge}}\]
\[\def\Func{\mathsf{Func}}\]
\[\def\Id{\mathsf{Id}}\]
\[\def\src{\mathsf{src}}\]
\[\def\tgt{\mathsf{tgt}}\]
\[\def\obj{\mathsf{obj}}\]
\[\def\mor{\mathsf{mor}}\]
\[\def\natTo{\overset{.}{→}}\]
\[\def\Obj{\mathsf{Obj}\,}\]
\[\def\List{\mathsf{List}\,}\]
</p>
<p>
After this, only pure latex commands should exist.
</p>

<p>
However, the whitespace they produce via MathJax is ignored
since the HTML div is not yet closed.

<p>
We attempt to motivate the structure of a Heyting Algebra
by considering ‘inverse problems’.
</p>

<p>
For example,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You have a secret number \(x\) and your friend has a secret number \(y\), which you've
communicated to each other in person.</li>
<li>You communicate a ‘message’ to each other
by adding onto your secret number.</li>
<li>Hence, if I receive a number \(z\), then I can <i>undo</i> the addition operation to find the ‘message’ \(m = z - y\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
What if we decided, for security, to change our protocol from using addition to using
minimum. That is, we encode our message \(m\) as \(z = x ↓ m\). Since minimum is not
invertible, we decide to send our encoded messages with a ‘context’ \(c\) as a pair \((z, c)\).
From this pair, a unique number \(m′\) can be extracted, which is not necessarily the original \(m\).
Read on, and perhaps you'll figure out which messages can be communicated 😉
</p>

<p>
This exploration demonstrates that relative pseudo-complements
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Are admitted by the usual naturals precisely when infinity is considered a number;</li>
<li>Are <i>exactly</i> implication for the Booleans;</li>
<li><i>Internalises</i> implication for sets;</li>
<li>Yield <i>the largest complementary subgraph</i> when considering subgraphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In some sense, the pseudo-complement is the “best approximate inverse” to forming meets, minima, intersections.
</p>

<p>
Along the way we develop a number of the theorems describing the relationships
between different structural components of Heyting Algebras;
most notably the internalisation of much of its own structure.
</p>

<p>
The article aims to be self-contained, however it may be helpful to
look at <a href="https://alhassy.github.io/CatsCheatSheet/LatticesCheatSheet.pdf">this lattice cheat sheet</a> (•̀ᴗ•́)و

Recall that an <i>order</i> is nothing more than a type \(Carrier\) with a relation
\(\_⊑\_\) such that the following list of axioms holds: For any \(x,y,z : Carrier\),
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{⊑-reflexive}{x ⊑ x}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{⊑-transitive}{x ⊑ y \landS y ⊑ z \impliesS x ⊑ z}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{⊑-antisymmetric}{x ⊑ y \landS y ⊑ x \impliesS x = y}\]
</p>

<p>
This models notions of containment, inclusion, hierarchy, and approximation.
</p>

<p>
Recall that a <i>meet</i> is an additional operation \(\_⊓\_\) specified by
\[\eqnColour{Meet Characterisation}{ z \;⊑\; x ⊓ y \equivS z ⊑ x \landS z ⊑ y}{green}\]
</p>

<p>
Meets model notions of <i>greatest lower bounds</i>, or <i>infima</i>.
</p>

<p>
Observe that <i>meets allow us to encode a pair of inclusions as a single inclusion!</i>
That is, an <i>external</i> conjunction \(∧\) is equivalent to an <i>internal</i> meet \(⊓\).
</p>

<p>
In computing parlance, think of a top-level ‘method’ that takes and yields
data. In many languages, the method itself can be thought of as data!
It is this kind of external-internal duality we are alluding to
&#x2013;and is captured nicely by exponential objects in category theory,
of which we are considering a special case.

<li><p>
However, we cannot define complement in the same fashion, since the resulting relation
is not over the resulting vertex set!

the discrete graph \((V, ø)\) has complement \((ø, E)\) which is a ‘graph’
with many edges \(E\) but no vertices! &#x2014;Provided \((V,E)\) has edges.
</p>

<p>
However, the edges can be <i>relativised</i> to the vertices to produce the pseudo-complement.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-The-Principle-of-Indirect-Equality">
<p>
It is not clear how \(\ref{Meet Characterisation}\) can be used to <i>prove</i>
properties about meet.
</p>

<p>
The laws \ref{⊑-antisymmetric} and \ref{⊑-reflexive} can be fused together
into one law:
\[\eqnColour{Indirect Equality}{ x = y \equivS \left(∀ z \;•\quad ⊑\; z ⊑ x \equivs z ⊑ y\right)}{green}\]
</p>

<p>
That is, <i>for all practical purposes, \(x = y\) precisely when they have the same sub-parts!</i>
</p>

<p>
Using this, we can prove that meet is idempotent \(x ⊓ x = x\),
symmetric \(x ⊓ y = y ⊓ x\), associative \(x ⊓ (y ⊓ z) = (x ⊓ y) ⊓ z\),
and monotonic: \(a ⊑ b \landS c ⊑ d \impliesS a ⊓ c \sqleqS b ⊓ c\).
</p>

<p>
Below we use this principle in a number of places, for example \ref{Distributivity of → over ⊓}.

<h2 id="Relative-Pseudo-complements"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> <a href="#Relative-Pseudo-complements">Relative Pseudo-complements</a></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Relative-Pseudo-complements">
<p>
The <i>relative pseudo-complement of \(a\) wrt \(b\)</i>, \((a ⟶ b)\),
is <i>“the largest element \(x\) that ensures modus ponens”</i>, i.e.,
<i>“the largest element \(x\) whose meet with \(a\) is contained in \(b\)”</i>:
</p>

<p>
\[\eqnColour{Relative Pseudo-Complement Characterisation}{\hspace{-5em} a ⊓ x \;⊑\; b  \equivS  x \;⊑\; (a → b)}{green}\]
</p>

<p>
This is also sometimes denoted \(a ➩ b\) or \(a \backslash b\).
</p>

<p>
In five of the above settings this becomes,
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p>
\(m ↓ x ≤ n  \equivS  x ≤ (m → n)\)
</p>

<p>
Not at all clear what to do so looking for a counterexample
shows that pseduocomplements cannot exist for the naturals
otherwise selecting \(m ≔ n\) yields:
</p>

\begin{calc}
   ∀ x \;•\quad  n ↓ x \;≤\; n \equivS x \;≤\; (n → n)
\step{ Weakening: The minimum is at least both its arguments }
   ∀ x \;•\quad  \mathsf{true} \equivS x \;≤\; (n → n)
\step{ Identity of ≡ }
   ∀ x \;•\quad  x \;≤\; (n → n)
\step{ Definition of Infinity }
   (n → n) \;=\; +∞
\end{calc}

<p>
Thus the existence of psquedo-complements implies the existence of a top element “\((n ⟶ n) = +∞\)”!
</p>

<p>
Okay, no problem: Let's consider 𝒩, the set of natural numbers along with a new maximum element “+∞”;
then we can define a relative pseudo-complement.
\[\eqn{Definition of → for 𝒩}{m → n \quad=\quad \mathsf{if}\; m > n \;\mathsf{then}\; n \;\mathsf{else}\; +∞ \;\mathsf{fi}}\]
We now have a way to approximate an inverse to minima, which is in general not invertible.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013;This definition works for any linear order with a top element&#x2014;
</p></li>

<li><p>
\(p ∧ x ⇒ q  \equivS  x ⇒ (p → q)\)
</p>

<p>
Starting with the right side,
</p>
\begin{calc}
   x \impliesS (p → q)
\step{ Characterisation of pseudo-complement }
   p ∧ x \impliesS q
\step{ Symmetry of ∧ }
   x ∧ p \impliesS q
\step{ Shunting }
   x \impliesS (p ⇒ q)
\end{calc}

<p>
Hence, by indirect equality, \(p → q \;=\; p ⇒ q \;=\; ¬ p ∨ q\).
</p></li>

<li><p>
\((A ∩ X)  \;⊆\;  B  \equivS  X  \;⊆\;  (A → B)\)
</p>

<p>
Where we can similarly verify \((A → B) \;\;=\;\; ∼ A ∪ B\).
</p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that \(x ∈ (A → B) \equivS x ∈ A \impliess x ∈ B\).
</p></li>

<li><p>
\(G ⊓ X \;⊑\; G′  \equivS  X \;⊑\; (G → G′)\)
</p>

<p>
We disclosed earlier that subgraph difference did not yield valid subgraphs,
but if we relativised the resulting edge relationship to only consider the
resulting vertex set, then we do have a subgraph.
</p>

<p>
That is, subgraphs admit relative pseduo-complements, by
\((V₁, E₁) → (V₂, E₂) \equivS (V₁ - V₂, (E₁ - E₂) ∩ (V₃ × V₃))\) where \(V₃ = V₁ - V₂\).
</p>

<p>
<i>The result of \(G₁ → G₂\) is the largest subgraph of \(G₁\) that does not overlap with \(G₂\).</i>
</p></li>

<li><p>
\((A × B → C) \equivS A → (B → C)\)
</p>

<p>
In the setting of functions, this says that a function taking a pair of inputs
can be considered as a function that takes one input, of type \(A\), then yields
another function that takes the second input. That is, the two inputs no longer
need to be provided at the same time. This is known as currying.
</p></li>

<li><p>
\(P, Q ⊢ R \equivS P ⊢ (Q → R)\)
</p>

<p>
In the logical formulae setting,
the characterisation is known as <i>the deduction theorem</i> and allows us
to ‘suppose’ an antecedent in the process of a proof.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In the above we have witnessed that the usual naturals admit pseudo-complements precisely
when infinity is considered a number, that it is <i>exactly</i> implication for the Booleans,
that it <i>internalises</i> implication for sets, and for subgraphs it is encodes
<i>the largest complementary subgraph</i>.
</p>

<p>
In some sense, the pseudo-complement is the “best approximate inverse” to forming minima.
</p>

<p>
We leave the remaining example as an exercise 😉

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Theorems-Generalising-Observations-from-the-Examples">
<p>
Recall the \ref{Relative Pseudo-Complement Characterisation} says
\[a ⊓ x \;⊑\; b  \equivS  x \;⊑\; (a → b)\]
</p>

<p>
We readily obtain some results by making parts of the characterisation true.
E.g., making the left/right part true by instantiating the variables.
</p>

<p>
For example, taking \(x ≔ (a → b)\) yields
\[\eqn{Modus Ponens}{a ⊓ (a → b) \quad⊑\quad b}\]
Exercise: Prove this directly!
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In the Boolean setting, this reads “if \(a\) is true and \(a\) implies \(b\), then \(b\) is true”.</li>
<li>In the functional setting, this reads “if \(f : A → B\) and we have an element \(a : A\), then
we have an element \(f(a) \, : \, B\)”. In this setting, this operation is known as ‘evaluation’,
or <i>function application</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Using the principle of indirect equality, we can strengthen this into an equality
and also obtain a close variant.
\[\eqn{Strong Modus Ponens}{a ⊓ (a → b) \quad=\quad a ⊓ b}\]
</p>
<p>
\[\eqn{Absorption}{b ⊓ (a → b) \quad=\quad b}\]
</p>
<p>
\ref{Modus Ponens} suggest an order preservation property:
</p>
\begin{calc}
   a → x \quad⊑\quad a → y
\step{ \ref{Relative Pseudo-Complement Characterisation} }
   a ⊓ (a → x) \quad⊑\quad y
\stepWith{\Leftarrow}{ \ref{⊑-transitive} }
   a ⊓ (a → x) \quad⊑\quad x \landS x \quad⊑\quad y
\step{ \ref{Modus Ponens} and Identity of ∧ }
   x \quad⊑\quad y
\end{calc}
<p>
Hence we have derived the following <i>consequent weakening rule</i>,
\[\eqn{Monotonicity₂}{a → x \quad⊑\quad a → y \qquad\Leftarrow\qquad x \;⊑\; y}\]
</p>

<p>
An immediate sequel is,
\[\eqn{Weakening₂}{a → (x ⊓ y) \quad⊑\quad a → y}\]
</p>

<p>
Here are a few more properties for you to get familiar with this,
the first three are immediate instantiation of the characterisation,
while the fourth one may require using monotonicity properties of meet,
and the final one uses indirect equality.
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Top Element}{x \quad⊑\quad a → a}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Strengthening}{b \quad⊑\quad a → b}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{UnCurrying}{x \quad⊑\quad a → a ⊓ x}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Weakening}{x \quad⊑\quad (a ⊓ b) → b}\]
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Antitonicity₁}{a → x \quad⊑\quad b → x \qquad\Leftarrow\qquad b \;⊑\; a}\]
</p>
<p>
\[\eqn{Self-Sub-Distributive}{a → (b → c)  \sqleqS  (a → b) → (a → c)}\]
</p>
<p>
Observe that, in the functional case, \ref{UnCurrying} says we have a function
\[X → (A → (A × X)) \;\;:\;\; x \mapsto (a \mapsto (a, x))\]

Recall \ref{Top Element} said that we have a greatest element in the order.
Suppose our universe, \(Carrier\), is non-empty and has some element \(c₀\).
Then we may <i>define</i> \(⊤ = (c₀ → c₀)\). This element is in-fact invariant
over \(c₀\):
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Top Element Invariance}{ ∀ x \;•\quad ⊤ \quad=\quad (x → x) }\]
The proof is simply an appeal to \ref{⊑-antisymmetric} then \ref{Top Element}
twice.
</p>

<p>
From this, we obtain two immediate properties about meets.
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Identity of ⊓}{ x ⊓ ⊤ \quad=\quad x }\]
</p>
<p>
\[\eqn{Shunting}{x \;⊑\; a → (b → c) \equivS x \;⊑\; (a ⊓ b) → c}\]
</p>
<p>
Along with two properties about top element.
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Right Zero of →}{ x → ⊤ \quad=\quad ⊤ }\]
</p>
<p>
\[\eqn{Left Identity of →}{ ⊤ → x \quad=\quad x }\]
</p>
<p>
Notice that \ref{Right Zero of →} <i>internalises</i> what it means to
be a \ref{Top Element}; namely \(∀ x \;•\; x ≤ ⊤\).
</p>

<p>
A bit more interestingly, we can <i>fuse</i> a meet with a pseudo-complement:
</p>

<p>
\[\eqn{Sub-mutual Associtivity of ⊓ and →}{\hspace{-3em}x ⊓ (a → b)  \sqleqS (x ⊓ a) → b}\]
</p>
<p>
The converse of this statement is not true in general.
In particular, in the presence of bottoms, the converse,
\((x ⊓ a) → b   \;\;⊑\;\;   x ⊓ (a → b)\), implies that there is only
one possible value: ⊥!
</p>

<p>
Exercise: Show that the converse statement implies \(⊥ = ⊤\)
then from this conclude that \(x = ⊥\), for all \(x\).

We have seen how relative pseudo-complements allowed us to reflect
external characterisations such as \ref{Top Element} that use
logical connectives into internal forms such as \ref{Right Zero of →}
which only <i>uses the symbols of the language</i>, namely →, ⊓, ⊤.
</p>

<p>
Even the order, which takes two elements and yields a Boolean, can be internalised:
\[\eqn{Internalising}{a ⊑ b  \equivS  (a → b) = ⊤}\]
</p>
<p>
Notice the striking resemblance to the \ref{Definition of → for 𝒩}!
</p>

<p>
\ref{Meet Characterisation} can also be internalised:
</p>
\begin{calc}
x \sqleqS (a → c) \;⊓\; (a → b)
  \step{ \ref{Meet Characterisation} }
x ⊑ (a → c) \landS  x ⊑ (a → b)

a ⊓ x \sqleqS c ⊓ b
  \step{ \ref{Relative Pseudo-Complement Characterisation} }
x \sqleqS  a → (c ⊓ b)

Suppose we have a <i>least element</i> \(⊥ : Carrier\), i.e., for any \(x\),
\[\eqn{Bottom Element}{ ⊥ \sqleqs x}\]
</p>

<p>
For usual ℕ, 𝔹, sets, and graphs this amounts to 0, \(\mathsf{false}\), \(\emptyset\), and the
empty graph with no nodes nor any edges, respectively.

Unsurprising this can also be internalised!
\[\eqn{ex falso quod libet}{⊥ → a \quad=\quad ⊤}\]

\[\eqn{Pseudo-Complement Definition}{ ¬ x \quad=\quad (x → ⊥) }\]

<p>
<i>A complement</i> of an element \(x\) is an element \(y\) that is

<p>
<i>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocomplement">pseudo-complement</a></i> generalises this idea by discarding the second half

We now have the linguistic prerequisites to actually express De Morgan's laws.
\[\eqn{Constructive De Morgan}{¬(x \;⊔\; y) \quad=\quad ¬ x \;⊓\; ¬ y}\]
</p>

<p>
The other form \(¬(x ⊓ y) \;=\; ¬ x ⊔ ¬ y\) however is not true in general.
Likewise neither are double negation, \(¬¬x \;=\; x\), nor the law of the

Indeed for 𝒩, the natural numbers extended with +∞, the law of the exluded middle
