# I'd like to discuss the importance of Arabic's short vowels and their use to give Arabic flexible word order.

 How do Arabs say the English “a/an/the”, as in “an apple” or “the chair”? Easy! By default, all words are /indefinite/
 (“a/an”); and made /definite/ (“the”) by adding الـ to the front of the word.

 But... there's some subtleties, which first require us to discuss vowel markings... which also change if the /feminine
 marker/ ة is used, so we also need to briefly discuss gender.

English relies on /word order/ for meaning; for example, /Jim hit Bob/ is a sentence where the person doing the action is
/Jim/ and we know it has to be /Jim/, and not /Bob/, since /Jim/ is the word /before/ the action /hit/. However, in Arabic words can
be ordered in almost any way you like! Then how do we identifiy who does an action? We use case markings: We add small
symbols to the end of words to indiciate the role they play in a sentence.

* Abstract Continued :ignore:
As such, we're gonna introduce a bunch of zany concepts:
1. Markings that may be written, or not, depending on formality
2. A sentence's meaning can change /without changing the order of words/, provided we change the final markings on words
3. Words can move around in a sentence /without/ changing meaning, if final markings are changed to maintain the existing
  meaning
4. Gender,
5. Definiteness,
6. Sun and Moon Letters.

One day, my wife and I were looking at the word خبز, and we each read
it differently: I read it as خَبَزَ “he baked”, but she read it as خُبْز
“bread”. Without a context, we each guessed different short vowels!

Here's another one...

** One word, many readings
What does حملت mean? Since ح−م−ل means “carrying”, and ـت is the past tense suffix, we have /at least/ the following meanings:
| حَمَلْتُ | I carried               |
| حَمَلْتَ | You (masculine) carried |
| حَمَلْتِ | You (feminine) carried  |
| حَمَلَتْ | She carried             |
| حُمِلتْ  | She was carried         |

Without the short symbols, the only way to distinuigh the intended
meaning is for the word to be contextually located within a sentence
---and even then, this would require experience.

** Word Order

Likewise, what does نصرت فاطمة mean? Does it mean “Fatimah helped (someone)”? Or does it mean “Fatimah was helped (by
someone)”?


One English sentence can be written a number of ways in Arabic:

| Fatima helped Zaynab |
|----------------------|
| نصرت فاطمةُ  زينبَ         |
| نصرت زينبَ فاطمةُ          |
| فاطمةُ نصرت زینبَ          |
The way the listener knows what’s the subject and what’s the object is quite literally carried around with the nouns themselves. The endings make all the difference.

The second instance above might seem weird at first, since the object comes before the subject, but it is more common
when the object is an attached pronoun:
| نصرتْها فطمةُ | Fatima helped her. |

This is a common example of the verb-object-subject word order!

** So, what's the deal?

Just as people dress according to roles or occassions (such as a
suit at work and pajamas in bed), so too Arabic words have
different case endings, التشكيلُ, to show their roles within a
sentence.

Roles are indicated by the vowel sign on the final letter of a word.
   |----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | Role                             | Ending Vowel | Case (Grammatical Name) |
   |----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | Subject; the one doing an action | ـُــ            | مرفوع / Nominative       |
   | Object; the one being acted upon | ـَــ            | منصوب / Accusative     |
   | Owner of a thing                 | ـِــ            | مجرور / Genetive         |


*Nunation*: When the word is indefinite, one “doubles” the symbols,
which causes an extra /-n/ sound to each vowel: u ـُـ, a ـَـ, i ـِـ
are replaced by un ـٌـ, an ـًـ, in ـٍـ. This is covered below.

** Formality: When do we see these markings?

Depending on the formality of some Arabic text, such as Classical Arabic or Quranic Arabic, you might see and hear
additional grammatical endings.

The endings change depending on the function of the noun in a sentence /and/ whether it is definite or indefinite.
* ة ---Gender and “tied-up t/ت”
Arabic nouns (words that name people, objects, or ideas) are classified as
/masculine/ مُذَكَّر (“mudhakkar”) or /feminine/ مُؤَنَّث (“mu'annath”).

#+begin_box "Arabic Gender Rule"
# There's a simple rule-set to determine the category of a word:

In general, /if a word ends in ة or refers to a female _person_, then it is a feminine word; otherwise it is a masculine
word./

In more detail:
1. Words that end with the “feminine ending marker” ة are مُؤَنَّث.
   - The ة is known as the /Taa Marbuta/ (literally: “tied-up ت”) and it is pronounced as a short vowel /a/ sound.

2. Words referring to female /people/ but not ending in ة are مُؤَنَّث.

3. Country names, natural features, and parts of the body that come in pairs are مُوَّنَّث.

4. Everything else is مُذَكَّر

# I'm intentionally keeping these ordered: That way they can  be used as “examples” when one hovers over them, and again

* /Formally/ Indefinite: “a/an” or “un” ـٌــ
Isolated nouns are sometimes shown with the تنوين (“tanween”) ending showing that they are indefinite.

Tanween, تنوين,literally means “putting a nun/ن on”, and for this reason is sometimes called /nunation/. It is written as
a small symbol ـٌـ above the final letter and pronounced /un/.

| a boy | ولدٌ  | “waladun”   |
| a car | سيّارةٌ | “sayaratun” |

Notice that if a noun ends in ة “tied-up t”, the /t/ is actually
pronounced before the Tanween.

* Definite - “the” or “al”  الـــ

Everyday, non-formal, Arabic has no separate word for “a/an”, as in “a chair” or “an apple”.
- By default, words are /indefinite/: For example, مكتب means “an office”, even though there is no separate word for the
  “an”.
- To make a noun /definite/ we add الـ “al” /joined/ to it, which means “the”.
  For example:
  |   “the office”     |
  | ≈ “the” + “office” |
  | ≈  ال + مكتب        |
  | ≈  المكتب            |

Frequently, the sound of الـ /al/ may have both the /a/ sound, the /l/ sound, or both sound change!
The rules are pretty simple.
- These are changes in pronunciation /only/, the spelling of “al” الـ doesn't change.
#+begin_details "Elision: The “a” of “al” الـ is silent if the previous word ends in a vowel"

If الـ “al” comes directly after a vowel, the “a” of “al” الـ will drop out, or elide, leaving just the “l” sound. This
only affects pronunciation and not the spelling.

For example,
| the house    | البيت   | “al-bayt”   |
| in the house | في البيت | “fi l-bayt” |
#+end_details

#+begin_details "Assimilation: The Sun Letters Assimilate the “l” of “al” الـ"

Nouns starting with certain letters of the Arabic alphabet cause the pronunciation of “al” الـ to change: The “l” sound
becomes the same as the first sound of the noun. This double-pronunciation of the first letter of the noun is indicated
with a Shadda ـّـ symbol, if vowel marks are written.

For example,
| a car   | سيّارة  | “sayyara”   |
| the car | السّيّارة | “as-sayyara” |

Notice that السّيّارة is *not* read “al-sayyara”! The “l” sound changes to be the sound of the first letter of سيّارة, namely
“s”.

Likewise, /a river/ is نهر whereas /the river/ is النّهر “an-nahr”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The letters which cause this pronunciation assimilation are called
*sun letters*, الحروف الشمسية “al-huruf ash-shamsiyya”, as ش/sh is itself an assimilating letter. Half of Arabic's 28 letters are Sun Letters.
The remaining half of the letters are called Moon Letters,
الحروف القمرية “al-huruf al-gamariyya”, as ق/G is not an assimilating letter.

+ 🌙 Moon Letters :: ا ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي
#+end_details

Formally, when a noun is made definite, the final case ending
becomes ـُـ “-u”. For example,
| a boy   | ولدٌ | “walad-un”   |
| the boy | الولدُ | “al-walad-u” |
