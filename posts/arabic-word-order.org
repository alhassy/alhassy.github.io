#+description: Discovering how to say “a/an/the” in Arabic leads onto a zany adventure into case markings, gender, annexation, non-verbal sentences, plurals, and concludes with whether “Muslims” is مسلمون or مسلمین ---it's both!

* Abstract                                                           :ignore:

# I'd like to discuss the importance of Arabic's short vowels and their use to give Arabic flexible word order.

In short: In English sometimes we mess-up between “I/me/my”, likewise in Arabic we might mess up with “ابو / ابا / ابي”:
These are just اب followed by one of ا/ي/و (which are the pronounced case endings!)

#+begin_center

 How do Arabs say the English “a/an/the”, as in “an apple” or “the chair”? Easy! By default, all words are /indefinite/
 (“a/an”); and made /definite/ (“the”) by adding الـ to the front of the word.

 But... there's some subtleties, which first require us to discuss vowel markings... which also change if the /feminine
 marker/ ة is used, so we also need to briefly discuss gender.

English relies on /word order/ for meaning; for example, /Jim hit Bob/ is a sentence where the person doing the action is
/Jim/ and we know it has to be /Jim/, and not /Bob/, since /Jim/ is the word /before/ the action /hit/. However, in Arabic words can
be ordered in almost any way you like! Then how do we identifiy who does an action? We use *[[green:case markings]]*: We add small
symbols to the end of words to indiciate the role they play in a sentence.

With vowel markings, we can finally flesh-out the nature of
“a/an/the” in Arabic... but then something wild happens if we stick
an (in)definite /followed by/ a definite! We get the concepts of ownership and complete sentences that don't need a verb!

Finally, we conclude with an explanation of why in the world English Qurans use the single word /muslim/ where's Arabic
Qurans use both مسلمون and مسلمين.

* Remark on <details> :ignore:
Some *green:interesting* concepts will also be mentioned, for those curious, but should be ignored on a first
reading. These will be hidden away in /clickable/foldable/ regions.

These are notes of things that I'm learning; there's likely errors.

* Remark on what نحو means :ignore:

[[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D9%86%D8%AD%D9%88][نحو]] literally means /direction/; but [[https://altaysir.wordpress.com/2010/09/22/pkik9-ce/][when talking about Arabic grammar]], it means /syntax/ (how words are combined to form
phrases) and, in-particular, case endings / إعراب.

One day, my wife and I were looking at the word خبز, and we each read
it differently: I read it as خَبَزَ “he baked”, but she read it as خُبْزْ
“bread”. Without a context, we each guessed different [[doc:arabic-vowels][short vowels]]!

# NOTE: The following block was copy/pasted from ~/blog/posts/arabic-glossary.org
#+begin_details "Tell me more about vowels!"
Arabs /infer/ vowels from context, otherwise words alone such as حمل are ambigious: It could mean حَمَلَ “he carried” or حُمِلْ
“he was carried”.

As an example sentence with vowels written, Prophet Muhammad is known to have said:
| أنَا مَدِينَةُ الْعِلْمِ وَعَلَيٌ بَابُهَا                                |
| /I am the city of knowledge and Ali is its gate/ |

Incidentally, Ali was the one who commissioned the system of vowels.
https://blogs.transparent.com/arabic/the-beginning-of-dotting-and-diacritics-in-arabic/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arabic has only three short vowels, or حركات (literally: “movements”), which are written as small symbols above/below
letters.

| Vowel name  | Vowel sound | Arabic | English example |
| Fatha;  فتحة  | /a/           | ـَ       | /mat/             |
| Dhamma; ظمّة  | /u/           | ـُ       | /sugar/           |
| Kasra; كسرة  | /i/           | ـِ       | /bit/             |

The “no vowel” marker is suukun/سكون: While هههه has its vowels guessed to be هَهَهَهَ “hahahah”, we obtain “hhhh” by using
sukkun, هْهْهْهْ. It is important for consonant-vowel-consonant syllables, such as بَابْ “bab” which means /door./

Incidentally, when a sound needs to be repeated twice, it is usually written once with a /Shadda/ ـّـ to indicate the
doubling.  For example, فَهِمَ /fahima/ “he understood” but فَهَّمَ /fahhama/ “he explained”. Shadda is used with الـ + ‘sun
letters’. Unlike the other short vowels, the Shadda is usually written even in informal Arabic, to avoid ambiguity.


Arabic has 3 long vowels, which are formed using specific letters /after/ the short vowels:
 | Long vowel  sound | Arabic | English example |
 | /aa/                | ـَا      | /far/             |
 | /ii/                | ـِي      | /meet/            |
 | /uu/                | ـُو      | /boot/            |

Since short vowels are normally not written, letters ا ي و play two roles: They behave as long vowels /aa,ii,uu/ (when
preceded by short vowels) and also behave as consonant sounds /a,y,w/.
 + For example, as a consonant, [[https://arabic.fi/letters/74][ي]] makes an English “y” sound; but as a long vowel it makes an “ii” sound.
 + Occasionally, /aa/ is written using ی (which is like ي but without the dots), or یٰ, rather than an
   /alif/. This always happens at the end of a word and is called /alif maqsuura/
   “broken alif”; for example علی “on” and موسیٰ “Musa”.

The following video reads all Arabic letters, where each letter is vowelised by one of the 3 short vowels. It's a really
nice video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1Cl6W8EEBQ?start=6.
#+end_details

Here's another one..
** One word, many readings
What does حملت mean? Since ح−م−ل means “carrying”, and ـت is the past tense suffix, we have /at least/ the following meanings:
| حَمَلْتُ | I carried               |
| حَمَلْتَ | You (masculine) carried |
| حَمَلْتِ | You (feminine) carried  |
| حَمَلَتْ | She carried             |
| حُمِلتْ  | She was carried         |

Without the short symbols, the only way to distinguish the intended
meaning is for the word to be contextually located within a sentence
---and even then, this would require experience.

** The Verb System                          :ignore:

#+html: <br>
#+begin_details "Tell me more about how verbs change, conjugate!"
Arabic verbs are conjugated in the past tense by adding suffixes to the stem of the verb.
|    | singular | plural |
| 1  | ـْتُ       | ـْنا      |
| 2m | ـْتَ       | ـْتُمْ      |
| 2f | ـْتِ       | ـْتُنَّ     |
| 3m | ـَـ        | ـُوا      |
| 3f | ـَتْ       | ـْنَّ  |

For example, “they (feminine) studied” is هُنَّ دَرَسْنَّ.
# *Exercises!*
+ Exercise: Conjugate /to study/ دَرَسَ for each subject above.
  ( [[http://allthearabicyouneverlearnedthefirsttimearound.com/p1/p1-ch3/verbs-past-tense-and-the-accusative-case/][Answer]] )
+ Exercise: Conjugate /to be generous/ كَرُمَ and /to drink/ شَرِبَ.
+ Exercise: What does درست mean?
  - /Trick question!/ You need the context, sentence, to /infer/ the required
    conjugation.
# #+begin_details Solutions
# TODO
# #+end_details
#

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the conjugation for the third-person masculine, هُمْ/they,
is /not phonetic/: The ending ـُوا has the long vowel ـُو pronounced, but the alif is silent. E.g., /they studied/ is هُمْ دَرَسُوا
and is read “hum darasuu”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The personal pronouns (/I, you, they, etc/) are not usually used, since the verb conjugation tells us who the
subject is.  Sometimes they are used for emphasis.
E.g., /they studied/ is دَرَسُوا
and is read “darasuu”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Arabic has no “to X” form, as in English /to eat, to drink, etc/.  Instead, it uses the /he/ form of a verb when referring
to a verb in-general.  For example, /he studied/ دَرَسَ is used to mean /to study/ when we are taking about how the verb /to
study/ changes depending on who is doing the studying. This form is chosen since it is the *simplest form*: It's the main 3
root consontants of the verb, followed by a fatHa.


#+end_details

** Word Order

Likewise, what does نصرت فاطمة mean? Does it mean “Fatimah helped (someone)”? Or does it mean “Fatimah was helped (by
someone)”?


One English sentence can be written a number of ways in Arabic:

|         <c>          |
| Fatima helped Zaynab |
|----------------------|
|    نصرت فاطمةُ  زينبَ     |
|     نصرت زينبَ فاطمةُ     |
|     فاطمةُ نصرت زینبَ     |


The way the listener knows what’s the subject and what’s the object is quite literally carried around with the nouns
themselves. The endings make all the difference.
#+begin_center
#+begin_green
*This is [[http://ejtaal.net/aa/#hw4=715,ll=2080,ls=5,la=2863,sg=701,ha=473,br=634,pr=104,vi=257,mgf=593,mr=420,mn=911,aan=407,kz=1608,uqq=237,ulq=1202,uqa=286,uqw=1064,umr=711,ums=591,umj=524,bdw=587,amr=425,asb=640,auh=1033,dhq=365,mht=591,msb=159,tla=70,amj=516,ens=28,mis=1439][اعراب]], /I'rab/, which [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%B9_%D8%B1_%D8%A8#Derived_terms][literally]] means “to Arabize” or
“to make elegant/clarify”.*
#+end_green
#+end_center

The second instance above might seem weird at first, since the object comes before the subject, but it is more common
when the object is an attached [[doc:arabic-pronouns][pronoun]]:
| نصرتْها فطمةُ | Fatima helped her. |

This is a common example of the verb-object-subject word order!

** Where is this case stuff in English!?

This /words-changing-due-to-role/ behaviour also happens in English, but mostly with [[doc:arabic-pronouns][pronouns]]: For example, /purple:He saw
orange:me   ≈   [[orange:I]] was seen by purple:him/.
# |   *purple:He* saw *orange:me*.         |
# | ≈ *[[orange:I]]* was seen by *purple:him*. |

In English, there are 3 ways to refer to oneself: *[[green:I]], red:me, blue:my*.
For example,
| *blue:My* cat saw *red:me*, and *[[green:I]]* jumped!  |
Here's the rules:
- /(Nominative!)/ When I am doing something, I say: *[[green: I did it.]]*
- /(Accusative!)/ When something is being done to me, I say: *[[red: It was done to me.]]*
- /(Genitive!)/ When I have an item, I say: *[[blue: My thing....]]*

So the word used to refer to /myself/ changes depending on what is happening *green:by* me, *red:to* me, or *blue:of* me / what I
own.

#+begin_details "Um, actually there's a 4th way: myself!"
/Myself/ is the forth way to refer to oneself in English. Like *red:me*, it is used when something is being done to me /such that/
the person doing the action is also me ...err, myself.

Here are some examples,
| I care for myself, by running everyday. |
| I describe myself as happy.             |
| I like myself.                          |

# Only use “myself” if you've used “I”.
#
As a rule of thumb, /myself/ should only be used if /I/ is used in the same sentence. Otherwise, just use /me/.
#+end_details
** So, what's the deal?

Just as people dress according to roles or occassions (such as a
suit at work and pajamas in bed), so too Arabic words have
different case endings, التشكيلُ, to show their roles within a
sentence.

Roles are indicated by the vowel sign on the final letter of a word.
   |----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | Role                             | Ending Vowel | Case (Grammatical Name) |
   |----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | [[green:Subject; the one doing an action]] | ـُــ            | مرفوع / green:Nominative |
   | [[red:Object; the one being acted upon]] | ـَــ            | منصوب / red:Accusative  |
   | [[blue:Owner of a thing]]        | ـِــ            | مجرور / blue:Genitive     |


# The endings change depending on the function of the noun in a sentence /and/ whether it is definite or indefinite.

*Nunation/تنوين/Tanween:* When the word is indefinite, one “doubles” the symbols, which causes an extra /-n/ sound to each
vowel: u ـُـ, a ـَـ, i ـِـ are replaced by un ـٌـ, an ـًـ, in ـٍـ. (If a word does not end in ة, the ـًـ ending is written اً.)
This is all covered below.

** Formality: When do we see these markings?

Depending on the formality of some Arabic text, such as Classical Arabic or Quranic Arabic, you might see and hear
additional grammatical endings.

In this article, we'll see that these endings ---even when not explicitly written as markings---
do alter the writing of words in certain situations. For example,
درست كتابا has its markings guessed to be
دَرَسْتُ كِتَاباً */“[[green:I]] studied [[red:a book]]”/* ---the extra alif is really the alif-tanween of the accusative case, اً.

** /I can't live without vowels!/ Yes, you can! 💪

What do you think the following English sentences say?

#+begin_spoiler orange
#+begin_quote
- Y cn prbbly rd ths sly dspt th lck f vwls!

  ((Yes, you can live without vowels! You can even write English without them; it only needs some practice and the result is drastically shorter sentences! If need be, like Arabic, use vowels only when there is ambiguity.))
#+end_quote
#+end_spoiler

It might seem weird, for an English speaker, for vowels to be left-out, but conversely an Arabic speaker might think it's
extra effort in English to write out every vowel. It's different cultures, and traditions.

Just as it's a bit funny to drop the vowels in English, we can drop the dots in Arabic and the result is still somewhat
readable! In-fact, old Arabic did not have dots written down!

eg. school (مدرسةَ) it has a tanween, but when stopped on, the last letters tashkeel is ignored, so it sounds like (مدرسه).

* ة ---Gender and “tied-up t/ت”
Arabic nouns (words that name people, objects, or ideas) are classified as
/masculine/ مُذَكَّر (“mudhakkar”) or /feminine/ مُؤَنَّث (“mu'annath”).
This classification affects how other words in a sentence are written, just as action words or descriptive words.

#+begin_box "Arabic Gender Rule"
# There's a simple rule-set to determine the category of a word:

In general, /if a word ends in ة or refers to a female _person_, then it is a feminine word; otherwise it is a masculine
word./

In more detail:
1. Words that end with the “feminine ending marker” ة are مُؤَنَّث.
   - The ة is known as the /Taa Marbuta/ (literally: “tied-up ت”) and it is pronounced as a short vowel /a/ sound.

2. Words referring to female /people/ but not ending in ة are مُؤَنَّث.

3. Most country names, natural features, and parts of the body that come in pairs are مُوَّنَّث.

4. Everything else is مُذَكَّر

#+begin_details "Quranic Quandary: خَلِیفَة"
There are a few masculine words with the ة ending, but the only common on is خَلِيفَة “khalifa”. In the Quran this word has
the strict seance of /successor/ or /viceroy/. In later times, this was generalised to /caliph/.
#+end_details

** On the nature of /tied-up-t/

Taa Marbuta ة is a formed by taking the ends of ت and tying-them together to get ة.
(/Note: ت is also known as “ta mabsuta”, which literally means the “happy t” since the letter ت looks like a smiling face “🙂”)/
# ة only appears at the end of ism's/nouns/adjectives, never on verbs.


Examples:

   | 0. | grandfather           | جَدّ    | “jadd”             |
   | 1. | grandmother           | جَدَّة    | “jadda”            |
   | 2. | a grandmother         | جَدَّةً    | “jaddatan”         |
   | 3. | my grandmother        | جَدَّتي   | “jaddaty”          |
   | 4. | grandmothers          | جَدَّات  | “jaddaat”          |
   | 5. | the boy's grandmother | جَدَّةُ الولد | “jaddatu al-walad” |


+ Example #1 ::
  The Taa Marbuta is special in contrast to the other letters: It can only be written at the end of a word, either
  unjoined as ة or joined as ـَـة:
  - It is purely a grammatical letter, it has no sound!
    + It is the ending of most singluar feminine nouns/adjectives, or nouns referring to female people.
  - It /always/ follows a Fatha vowel, as in جدَة or غرفَة, and so people would say ة makes a short /a/ sound ---but this is
    really due to the vowel that always comes before ة!

+ Example #0 changes to #1 :: *[[green:As a suffix, ـَـة / ة is used to make feminine adjectives or nouns from masculine ones.]]*

+ Examples #2 and #3 :: It becomes “untied/opened ت” when suffixes/endings are added.
  - The formal indefinite, Example #2, is discussed below.

+ Example #4 :: A feminine word, ending in ـَـة is made plural by extending the Fatha into a long vowel ـَـا and opening
  the Taa Marbuta into ت.
  # + That is, the feminine plural for nouns in the suffix: ـات‎ (-āt)

+ Example #5 :: When it is followed by another word, the pronunciation of ة is /t/ −-−though the spelling remains
  unchanged. Putting two words beside each other is known as /possession, addition, إظافة/, and it's covered below.
  # In a possession construction, covered below, the pronunciation of ة is /t/ −-−though the spelling remains unchanged.

#+begin_details "ة has a number of other interesting uses"

+ It forms singulatives from collectives ::
  From a word that refers to a collection of things, we can refer to
  one of those things by adding ة.

  For example, we get /cow/ بَقَرَة‎ “baqara” from /cows/ بَقَر‎ “baqar”; and we get /tree/ شَجَرَة‎ “shajara” from /trees/ شَجَر‎ “shajar”.

  It is used this way to indicate /one of something/.  For example, from /watermelon/ بطيخ and /carrot/ جزر we obtain /one
  watermelon/ بطيخة and /one carrot/ جزرة.

+ It forms instances from general verbal nouns ::
  We can refer to a single instance of an action by adding ة.

  For example, we get /a smile/ اِبْتِسَامَة‎ “ibtisama” from /smiling/ اِبْتِسَام‎ “ibtisam”;
  and /an uprising/  اِنْتِفَاضَة‎ “intifatha” from /rising up/ اِنْتِفَاض‎ “intifith”.

+ It forms nouns referring to devices from occupational/characteristic nouns and adjectives ::

  For example, /tank/ دبابة “dabbaba” from /crawler/ دباب “dabab”; and /printer (device)/ طَابِعَة‎ “tabi'a” from /printer (person)/
  طَابِع‎ “tabi'”.

   |    | singular      | plural      |
   | 1  | أنا     /I/       | نَحْن   /we/     |
   | 2m | أَنْتَ    /you/     | أَنْتُم   /you/    |
   | 2f | أَنْتِ    /you/     | أَنتُن   /you/    |
   | 3m | هُوَ     /he/it/   | هُم    /they/  |
   | 3f | هِيَ     /she/it/ | هُنَّ     /they/ |

   When *I* am talking, the speaker is the “first person” (“1”);
   when taking *about you*, then you are the “second person”
   and may be masculine (“2m”) or feminine (“2f”), or a group of you (“plural”);
   finally, when talking about someone who is *not here* in the conversation,
   they are in the “third person” (“3m, 3f”).

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Possessive pronouns are the equivalent of the English /my, his, ours, .../.
    In Arabic, they are *joined to the end* of a word: For example,
    /house/ بیت becomes /my house/ بیتِي.

    Here are the attached possessive pronouns:

    |    | singular | plural |
    | 1  | ـِي        | ـنَا      |
    | 2m | ـكَ       | ـكُمْ     |
    | 2f | ـكِ       | ـكُنَّ    |
    | 3m | ـَهُ        | ـهُمْ     |
    | 3f | ـَهَا        | ـهُنَّ     |

    Exercise: Add these endings to the word /house/; for example, /my house/ بیتِي.

    :Broken_examples:
    /Warning!/ Shown is the nominative ending ـُـ, in 5 places above, but this can change to the genitive ending ـِـ or the
    accusative ending ـَـ. This, of-course, changes pronunciation.
    | I saw his house.    | . رأیتُ بیته  | ra'tu bayta-/ha/ ?? |
    | His house is large. | . بیتهُ كبیرُ | bayta-/hu/ kabeeru |

** Tanween, /Formally/ Indefinite, نَكِرَة: “a/an” or “un” ـٌــ

Technically, Arabic does not have an indefinite article like English's /a/an/.  Instead, indefininte/nonspecific words
have /doubled case markings/: So instead of ـِـ ـُـ ـَـ we have ـٍـ ـٌـ ـًـ, where the second marking is pronounced as a ن/n
sound.  This is known as تنوین/Tanween, or /nunation/, which means /pronouncing the letter ن at the end of a word/, or /putting a nun/ن on/.
(Often the double ـُـ is written as one ـُـ with a tail: ـٌـــ.)

| English | Arabic | Transliteration | Explanation                                    |
|---------+--------+-----------------+------------------------------------------------|
| a boy   | ولدٌ     | walad-un        | Nomative ـٌـ; a boy is doing something           |
| a book  | كتابٍ    | kitaab-in       | Genitive ـٍـ; a book is being owned              |
| a car   | سيّارةً    | sayarat-an      | Accusative ـًـ; something is happening to a car  |
| a book  | كتاباً     | kitaab-an       | Accusative ـاً; something is happening to a book |

+ Notice that if a noun ends in ة “tied-up t”, the /t/ is actually pronounced before the Tanween.
+ Secondly, unless a word ends in ة or ی or ـاء, then double-fatha ـًـ has to be written on an alif as اً. This alif is a
  spelling convention; it is not pronounced; unlike case markings, it is always written (e.g., كتابا possibly without
  the ـًـ).

** Definite, مَعْرِفَة - “the” or “al”  الـــ

There is no indefinite article equivalent to the English “a/an”.  However, the large majority of nouns and adjectives
have /tanween/ (the addition of the sound /n/) to the final vowel of a word) to indicate that the word is indefinite:

| a reward     | أجْرٌ | ajurn    |
| a sign/verse | آيْةٌ  | ayatun   |
| a recitation | قُرْآنٌ | qur'anun |

#+html: <br>
#+begin_details "What is آ ?"
It has become standard for a hamza followed by a long /aa/ sound to be written as two /alifs/, over vertical and on
horizontal: آ. This is known as the *alif madda*.

This was already discussed in: http://alhassy.com/arabic-roots#Arabic-has-112-symbols-and-112-sounds
#+end_details

However, in everyday, non-vowelised, Arabic there is no separate word/marking for “a/an”, as in “a chair” or “an apple”.
- By default, words are /indefinite/: For example, مكتب means “an office”, even though there is no separate word for the
  “an”.
- To make a noun /definite/ we add الـ “al” /joined/ to it, which means “the”.
  For example:
  |   “the office”     |
  | ≈ “the” ⇸ “office” |
  | ≈  ال ⇷ مكتب        |
  | ≈  المكتب            |

  #+begin_details "What are directed additions ⇸ and ⇷?"
  I will use /directed addition symbols/ ⇸ and ⇷ to mean the same
  as “+” but also to indicate the direction one should read it.
  For example, /X + Y/ could mean /X Y/ in English's left-to-right reading, but it could also mean /Y X/ in Arabic's
  right-to-left reading. Whereas /X ⇷ Y/ can only mean /X Y (read right-to-left)/.
  #+end_details

Frequently, the sound of الـ /al/ may have both the /a/ sound, the /l/ sound, or both sounds change!
The rules are pretty simple.
- These are changes in pronunciation /only/, the spelling of “al” الـ doesn't change.
#+begin_details "ٱلْـ / Elision: The “a” of “al” الـ is silent if the previous word ends in a vowel"

If الـ “al” comes directly after a vowel, the “a” of “al” الـ will drop out, or elide, leaving just the “l” sound. This
only affects pronunciation and not the spelling.

For example,
| the house    | البيت   | “al-bayt”   |
| in the house | في البيت | “fi l-bayt” |
#+end_details

#+begin_details "Assimilation: The Sun Letters Assimilate the “l” of “al” الـ"

Nouns starting with certain letters of the Arabic alphabet cause the pronunciation of “al” الـ to change: The “l” sound
becomes the same as the first sound of the noun. This double-pronunciation of the first letter of the noun is indicated
with a Shadda ـّـ symbol, if vowel marks are written.

For example,
| a car   | سيّارة  | “sayyara”   |
| the car | السّيّارة | “as-sayyara” |

Notice that السّيّارة is *not* read “al-sayyara”! The “l” sound changes to be the sound of the first letter of سيّارة, namely
“s”.

Likewise, /a river/ is نهر whereas /the river/ is النّهر “an-nahr”.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The letters which cause this pronunciation assimilation are called
*sun letters*, الحروف الشمسية “al-huruf ash-shamsiyya”, as ش/sh is itself an assimilating letter. Half of Arabic's 28 letters are Sun Letters.
The remaining half of the letters are called Moon Letters,
الحروف القمرية “al-huruf al-gamariyya”, as ق/G is not an assimilating letter.

+ ☀️ Sun Letters :: ت ث د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ل ن
+ 🌙 Moon Letters :: ا ب ج ح خ ع غ ف ق ك م ه و ي

Just as we use a shadda ـّـ on a sun letter, we place a sukoon ـْـ on the ل when it comes after moon letters: For example,
اَلْقمر “al-qamar” ---the sukoon gives us a slight pause after the “l” sound.
#+end_details

The above two rules are explained by the following theoretical justification.
#+begin_details "Um, actually the definite article is really just لْ" :title-color blue
In fact, the definite article is in essence simply a لْ, an “l” sound. But as Arabic phonetic theory holds that words
cannot begin with an unvowelled consonant, the vowel /a/ (Fatha) is added to the لْ to give اَلْ, /al/. Theory holds that this
/a/ vowel is not an integral part of the definite article and is required when no other vowel precedes the article
/l/. In effect this means that the added vowel is only at the beginning of a sentence. In other places, the vowel Fatha is
replaced by a “joining sign” (/wasla/) to obtain ٱلـ, which tells you to link the /l/ of the definite article to the final
vowel of the preceding word.

In short, you will find اَلْـ at the beginning, and ٱلْـ elsewhere in the sentence. The use of the two can be seen as
follows:

| the clear book | اَلْكِتَابُ ٱلْمُبِينُ | al-kitab-u l-mubeen-u

Note: In front of Sun Letters, اَلـ is written with /no sukkun/ on the ل, since there is no pause on the ل; in-fact the ل
is assimilated and makes a different sound altogether.

We will get to sentence formation, later below.
#+end_details


Exercise: From your knowledge of /pronunciation/ of ة and the two special pronunciation rules of الـ, guess how the following
would be read.
#+begin_spoiler green
| السَّيَّارَةُ الجَدِيْدَة                      |
| (( as-sayyara-tu l-jadded-a )) |
#+end_spoiler

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember: Since tanween indicates indefiniteness, a definite word /cannot/ have tanween!
| a boy   | ولدٌ | “walad-un”   |
| the boy | الولدُ | “al-walad-u” |

#+html: <br>
#+begin_details Quranic Quandary: اَل ⇷ ل = اَلّ
In the Quran, when the definite article is prefixed to a word
beginning with ل, only one ل is written. For example,
| the night | اَلَّیْلُ | al-laylu

This is not normally the case in modern Arabic.
#+end_details
* Idafa: (In)definite /followed/ by definite
** Possession: /Addition/ إظـافـة “idafa”

| What happens when you stick two nouns together? What about definiteness? |

Arabic expresses possession by placing two nouns next to each other: red:possessor  ⇷ green:possessed (read /right-to-left/).
This is إظـافـة, which literally means /addition/.

#+begin_parallel 3
| 1. red:Anwar's green:book |
| ≈  green:كتاب red:أنور  |

# Force a column break
#+html: <hr style="border:none; height:40px">
| 2. [[green:the manager]] of [[red:the department]] |
| ≈ [[red:the department's]] green:manager    |
| ≈ green:مدير red:القسم                      |

| 3. [[green:the manager]] of [[red:<em>a</em> department]] |
| ≈  [[red:<em>a</em> department's]] green:manager |
| ≈  green:مدير red:قسم                       |

#+end_parallel

Since *the* green:possessed item is /known/ to belong to the red:possessor, the English translations all use “the” before
the green:possessed item: /The [[green:X]] of [[red:Y]]/. That is, just as in English /red:Y's [[green:X]]/ means /X/ is known to
_definitely_ belong to /Y/, Arabic treats the green:possessed word in an إظافة as “definite in meaning” (even though it is
not “definite in form; has no الـ”); see example #3 above.

#  That is, green:possessed items are definite (and so cannot carry tanween).

The /result/ of an addition, إظافة, is noun phrase which itself can be the red:possessor of something else. Whether this
/result/ is definite or not is determined by whether the /final/ noun in the إظافة is definite or not; see example #2 above.


# #+begin_quote
#  /So, when you place two nouns next to each other, you get إظافة./
#  #+end_quote
# Moreover, by the previous discussion, there are only two kinds:
# | 1. [[red:Y]] [[green:X]] ≈ the X of /a/ Y |
# | 2. [[red:Yالـ]] [[green:X]] ≈ the X of /the/ Y  |

#+end_details

The /result/ of an addition, إظافة, is noun phrase which itself can be the red:possessor of something else. As such, we
can repeat the إظافة construction onto itself a number of times:
|   the son of the manager of the sales department                  |
| ≈ [[green:the son]] of [[red:(the manager of (the department of sales))]] |
| ≈ green:ابن [[red:مدير قسم المبيعات ]]

:useless:
Since there are two nouns, and each noun can have an الـ /or/ not,
there /seem/ to be a total of 4 different subcategories:
| green:سيارة red:ولد  | /the car of a boy/   |
| green:سيارة red:الولد  | /the car of the boy/ |
| green:السيارة red:ولد | Nonsense!          |
| green:السيارة red:الولد | Nonsense!          |

   | قَوْمُ سَوْءٍ            |

2. The use of certain words, such as /umm, ab, ibn, ahl, saahib, dhu/

| plural             | هؤَلاءِ    (/haa'ulaa'i/) | أُولئكَ (/'ulaa'ika/) |

Often non-verbal sentences are formed using demonstratives:

| This /is a/ book.    | .هذا كتاب |
| This /is/ my sister. | .هذهِ أُخْتي |
| That /is/ my mother. | .تِلْكَ أُمّي  |

| This /is a/ book.   | .هذا كتاب   |
| This book …       | … هذا الكتاب |
| This /is/ _the_ book. | .هذا هو الكتاب |

The first is a sentence, the second is not.  Finally, notice that you need to add the appropriate noun, in this case هو,

#+end_details

So, what kind of meaning do we get if we replace one of the nouns
in an Idafa construction with an adjective, a descriptive word?
*We get sentences!*
#+begin_center
*Descriptive Phrases      ≈    red:description ⇷ green:noun*
#+end_center

| 1. | (a) beautiful girl    | بنت جميلة   |
| 2. | (a) beautiful river   | نهر جميل   |

| 4. | the beautiful river   | النهر الجميل  |
| 5. | the beautiful river   | النهرُ الجميلُ  |
| 6. | their beautiful river | نهرهم الجميل |

Notice that the description جميل changes according to what is being described: The first has an extra ة since it's
describing a female, the third (and fifth) has markings that match the markings of what's being described, the fourth (and sixth!)
is definite since it's describing something definite.

#+begin_box Adjective Agreement
Adjectives are placed after the noun they describe, and agree with
the noun in gender, definiteness, number, and case endings.
(/Number/, or /plurality/, is the last thing covered in this article.)
#+end_box

#+html: <br>
#+begin_details "What if I have multiple adjectives?"

Just place them after the noun, as usual, and seperate them with /and/ وَ “wa”. Here's two examples, one definite and the
other indefinite.
| a large new school      | مدرسة كبيرة وَجديدة |
| the beautiful old chair | الكرسي الجميل وَالقديم

In the English *sentence* /Allah is powerful and mighty./, it is necessary to link the adjectives by using /and/. This is
not necessary in Arabic ---even though وَ could be used---, especially when tanween is fully pronounced. For example:
| .اَللّٰهُ قَوِيٌّ عَزِیزٌ                    |
| Allah is powerful and mighty. |

#+begin_details "An Exception: Colours as adjectives"

The (masculine) colours are as follows:

| red    | أحمَر  | ahmar   |
| blue   | أزرَق | azraG   |
| green  | أخضَر | akhthar |
| yellow | أصفَر | asfar   |
| black  | أسوَد | aswad   |
| white  | أبيَض | abyath  |

1. Notice that all colours start with أ and have a Fatha ـَـ on the next-to-last letter.
2. The feminine versions of colours are formed by pushing the أ to the end، dropping the ء to the floor, and bringing the
  Fatha to the first letter.
  + For example, masculine أحمَر has corresponding feminine
    حَمراء.
    Likewise, we have زَرقاء ، خَضراء ، صَفراء ، سَوداء ، بَيضاء .
3. Even though adjectives must agree with their nouns in case endings, colours are an exception: They always have the ـُـ
   ending, (for both definite /and/ indefinite).
   | a beautiful pen | قلمٌ جميلٌ  | Galam-/un/ jameel-/un/ |
   | a red pen       | قلمٌ أحمرُ   | Galam-/un/ ahmar-/u/   |
   | the red pen     | القلمُ الأحمرُ | al-Galam-/u/ al-ahmar-/u/ |
#+end_details

The rule about agreement in definiteness is crucial, because a definite noun followed by an indefinite adjective is a
complete sentence, not requiring a verb.  That is, mixing definiteness results in /sentences/, complete thoughts.
#+begin_center
*Non-verbal Sentences      ≈    [[red:indefinite description]] ⇷ [[green:defininite noun]]*
#+end_center
For example,
| The river /is/ beautiful. | ≈ | .النهر جميل |
| The river /is/ beautiful. | ≈ | .النهرُ جميلٌ |
| Allah is might.         | ≈ | .اَللّٰهُ عَزِیزٌ  |

Again, since Arabic's word classes put adjectives and nouns in the same group, اسم, we can replace the adjective with a
noun. For example,
| Yusuf /is/ beautiful. | ≈ | .يوسف جميل  |
| Yusuf /is a/ teacher. | ≈ | .يوسفُ مُدَرّسٌ |

Notice how cool that is! Arabic let's us create sentences without an equivalent for /am, is, are/ ---the subject is just
followed by the rest of the sentence. Moreover, notice that since subjects must have the nominative ending ـُـ/ـٌـ, the
rest of the sentence matches in case ---this is the same rule of matching for adjectives! (For this reason, non-verbal
sentences are also called /nominal sentences/.)

Here are some more examples:
| I /am/ busy today.      | .انا مَشْغول الیوم |
| The window /is/ broken. | .الشُّباك مَكْسور |

** TODO كان “I was X” and لِْسَ “I was not X” :ignore:low_priority:

#+begin_details "Laysa: Not-to-be"
If you want to make a nominal sentence negative, you need to use the special verb Laysa.

While Arabic doesn't use a verb “to be” (/is/am/are/) in simple non-verbal sentences,
it does have a verb “to /not/ be”!

We make a sentence, such as /Haani is a doctor/ هاني طبیب, negative by adding
لَیْسَ (and concluding the sentence in the accusative case)
or by adding لِیْسَ…بِـ (and concluding in the genitive case).

| Haani isn't a doctor. |
|. لِیْسَ هاني طبيباً          |
|. لِيْسَ هاني بِطبيب         |

لِيْسَ is unusual because it looks like a past verb, but always has a present meaning:
/Haani _wasn't_ a doctor/ would be لم یكن هاني طبیباً.

However, لِیْسَ does change according to the subject:
|    | singular           | plural              |
| 1  | لَسْتُ     /I'm not/    | لَسْنا     /we're not/    |
| 2m | لَسْتَ     /you're not/ | لَسْتُمْ     /you're not/   |
| 2f | لَسْتِ     /you're not/ | لَسْتُمْ     /you're not/   |
| 3m | لَیْسَ     /he's not/   | لَیْسوا     /they're not/ |
| 3f | لَیْسَتْ    /she's not/   | لَسْنَ     /they're not/  |

Just as in elementary school, we memorised multiplication times in math class;
when learning a new language there are various conjugation tables that must simply
be memorised.

Here's a final example,
| . لَستُ بِمُدرّس         |
| . لَستُ مُدرساً         |
| I'm not a teacher. |

** Describing Possession

Adjectives, descriptive words, come at the end of an Idafa ---even if they describe the first word in an Idafa.

The adjective will match the gender of the noun it is describing,
  and will have الـ if the noun is definite. For example, the presence of ة below is what decides which noun of the
  Idafa is being described.

  | the town's beautiful river | نهر المدينة الجميل |
  | the beautiful town's river | نهر المدينة الجميلة |

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a puzzler for you! What does the following sentence mean?

  |    شباك البيت السغير                    |
  | ≈?  the window of the /small/ house |
  | ≈?  the /small/ window of the house |

Answer...
# MA: Need the following on one line for the spoiler to be picked up as a /single/ unit.
#+begin_spoiler  orange
((It's not clear! Such ambiguities also exist in English! For example, “the boy touched the girl with the flower”: Does this mean the boy used a flower to touch the girl, or does it mean the boy touched the specific girl who had a flower with her.))
#+end_spoiler

However... Arabic has markings, or اعراب which literally means
“to make clear, eloquent”. As such, if we use markings, we can remove the ambiguity.
#+begin_box Adjective Agreement
Adjectives are placed after the noun they describe, and agree with
the noun in gender, definiteness, and case endings.
#+end_box

The /second/ noun in an Idafa (and any subsequent nouns) will have
the genetive case ending: Either ـِـ if definite, or ـٍـ if indefinite.
(The case of the first noun will vary depending on the role it plays within the sentence.)

As such, we have:

#+begin_parallel
   |   شباك البيتِ السغيرِ                    |
   |----------------------------------|
   | ≈  the window of the /small/ house |


   | شباكُ البيتِ السغيرُ                      |
   |----------------------------------|
   | ≈  the /small/ window of the house |

** TODO COMMENT Idafa -The crucial points to remember :low_priority:

Idafa is used to represent the association of one noun with another,
and is thus described as /the genitive of possession/. (The `genitive' may be a noun or a clause.)

Here are some examples to show how the Idafa works:
| the people of the book | اَّهْلُ ٱلْكِتَابِ |
| Allah's mercy          | رَحْمَةُ ٱللَّهِ  |

The crucial points to remember are:

1. The noun that is followed by this genitive *cannot* take either the definite article or Tanween. As such, a noun cam
   *either* take Tanween *or* have the defininte article *or*
   have a following genitive, but *only one* of these three.

2. The following genitive may be definite or indefinite in meaning.

3. In normal circumstances, *[[green: a noun followed by a genitive is definite in meaning.]]*.

   If an indefinite meaning is required another construction must be used. [The pronoun of separation?]

   To express possession of a noun with an indefinite meaning,
   prepositional constructions with /min/ and /li-/ are used:

   | a group of the faithful | طَائفَةٌ مِنَ ٱلْمُؤمِنِینَ |

** COMMENT Yakuun in nominal sentences       :low_priority:relocate_to_drafs:

You should include the appropriate form of the verb يكون if a sentence requires yuou to use the subjunctive, jussive, or imperative.


* Plurals: /Seeing إعراب in the main script!/

In English to talk about /many/ instance of a “house” or a “mouse” we use the words “houses” and “mice”. In Arabic, one
has to generally learn the plural when learning a word. However, there are two kinds of words that we just add an ending
to form the plural.

** Sound Feminine Plurals

For groups of females, or (female or male) /non-human/ nouns, we form the plural by adding ـَـات at the end of a word ---which is essentially just /expanding/ any existing ـَـة.

| /(female)/ | teacher  | مُدرّسة  | mudarrisa   |
| /(female)/ | teachers | مُدرّسَات | mudarrisaat |
| /(male)/   | animal   | حيوان  | Haywaan     |
|          | animals  | حيوانَات | Haywaanaat  |

Notice that the Arabic word for /animals/ is grammatically feminine.
In-general, the plurals of all non-humans are treated grammatically as /feminine singular/ 🤯 As such, for example,
descriptive words are singular for /animals/, but plural for /teachers/.
#+begin_parallel
| The /(female)/ teachers are beautiful. |
| ≈ المُدرّسَات جميلَات                      |

| The animals are beautiful. |
| ≈ الحيوانَات جميلة                |
#+end_parallel


** Sound Masculine Plural (SMP)

For groups of males, or groups of mixed males & females, we form the plural by adding ـُـونَ at the end of a word when the
word is doing the action (i.e., it's in the /nomiative/ case) and otherwise we add ـِـينَ.

| teacher                | مُدرّس      | mudarris                |
|------------------------+-----------+-------------------------|
| The teacher is here.   | المُدرّسُ هُنا  | al-mudarris-u huna      |
| The teachers are here. | المُدرّسُونَ هُنا | al-mudarris-uuna huna   |
|------------------------+-----------+-------------------------|
| I saw the teacher.     | رأیتُ ٱلمُدرّسِ | r'aytu al-mudrarris-i   |
| I saw the teachers.    | رأيتُ المُدرّسِينَ | r'aytu al-mudarris-iina |


Notice that the Irab in the singular are stretched out in the plural! Super cool stuff!
 + We see this often in the Quran, where God talks about
   مسلمون (Muslims doing something) and
   مسلمين (Muslims having something done to them, or owning something).


    The sound masculine plural is one of the few instances of the
    case ending being written as part of the main script and universally pronounced.

    #+begin_details "Here's another somewhat common one!"

    A few nouns have long final vowels when they are the first element in an Idafa.

    |            | nomative | accusative | genitive |
    |------------+----------+------------+----------|
    | father اب  | أَبُو        | أَبَا          | أَبِي       |
    | brother اخ | أَخُو       | أَخَا         | أَخِي       |

    #+end_details


    Since this plural explicitly indicates a case, either nomative
    with  ـُـونَ and otherwise with ـِـينَ;
    but the /second/ noun (and any subsequent nouns) in an Idafa
    must be in the genetive case. As such, in an Idafa whose /final/ word is a
    sound masculine plural, the ـِـينَ ending is always used.
    Moreover, when this plural is the /first/ word in an Idafa,
    it loses the shared ending ـنَ.
    For example,
    | The boy's teachers are here. | مُدرّسو الولدِ هُنا  |
    | I saw the boy's teachers.    | رأيتُ مُدرّسي الولدِ |

#+html: <br>
#+begin_details "Tell me more about why we lose ـنَ at the start of an Idafa"
In an Idafa, the first noun is definite (even when it does not start with الـ): In /X's Y/, we know that /Y/ belongs to /X/,
and so it's not some arbitrary unknown /Y/. As such, the first noun in an Idafa can only have the defininte case endings ـَ
ـِ ـُ and not the indefinite ones ـَ ـٍ ـٌ . It is for this reason that the final ـنَ ending of the SMP must be dropped when a
SMP is the first noun in an Idafa.


# Sound masculine plurals with a following genitive lose the final nun+fatha. This is best shown with the word ulu, which
# is the plural equivalent of dhu and is found only with a following genitive:

Here's some more examples:
#+begin_parallel
| أُولُو ٱلْأَلبَابِ               |
| ≈ /(literally!)/ possessors of hearts |
| ≈ men of understanding  |


| أُولِي ٱلْأَبْصَارِ                            |
| ≈ /(literally!)/ possessors of sight |
| ≈ men of insight                   |
#+end_parallel

Another example is /Children of Israel/ placed in an Idafa to get
/banu israil/ in the nomiative, and /banii israil/ in the genitive.
# #
# Exercise:
# #+begin_spoiler orange
# | child                          | ((?)) . TODO |
# | Israel                         | ((?)). TODO. |
# |                                |              |
# | I saw the Children of Israel.  | ((?)). TODO. |
# | The Children of Israel saw me. | ((?)). TODO. |

So, the way sound masculine plurals are written is due to the إعراب rules. We started with I'rab and ended with it;
we've come full circle 😊


** "The Dual Also Shows-off إعراب in the main script!"               :ignore:
#+html: <hr>
#+begin_details "Bonus: The Dual Also Shows-off إعراب in the main script!"

Arabic has three notions of /number/:
| Singular | When talking about /one/ thing,            |
| Dual     | When talking about /two/ things,           |
| Plural   | When talking about /three or more/ things. |

The dual is used for both masculine and feminine,
 | you (two) | أَنْتُما |
 | they (two) | هُما |

*[[green:If you want to refer to two people or things (/nouns/), you add the dual ending
ـانِ (“aani”) in the normative case and ـَینِ (“ayni”) in the accusative & genitive cases.]]*
| book كتاب |   | two books  | كتابانِ  |
| city مدینة |   | two cities | مدينتانِ |

The dual ending is also added to adjectives:
| هُناكَ مُمَرّضَتانِ جدیدتانِ في المُسْتشْفَی                    |
| There are two new nurses in the hospital. |
