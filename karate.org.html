What be this &#8220;Karate&#8221;?

The Gekisai kata <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are taught</span> as the first kata in the Goju Ryu Karate
syllabus. They <span class="writegood-passive-voice">were created</span> by Chojun Miyagi Sensei in 1940 as a way of
introducing the basic karate forms to a wider audience.

<span class="comment">#  In 1948, after WWII, Miyagi Sensei began to teach the Geki Sai Kata in depth as a regular part of Goju-Ryu in his own dojo. Until this time, Sanchin was the first Kata taught in Goju-Ryu. Sanchin Kata is physically and mentally a demanding Kata and requires a great deal of time and patience to learn and perform properly. The Geki Sai Katas however are easier to learn and perform, and contain dynamic techniques which are more attractive to young people.</span>

<span class="org-level-1">* </span><span class="org-special-keyword">COMMENT</span><span class="org-level-1"> Reasons for </span><span class="org-level-1"><span class="flyspell-duplicate">Kata</span></span>

Forms <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are known</span> as kata in Japanese martial arts,

<span class="writegood-weasels">Many</span> Goju-Ryu Karate schools use these katas in order to help students practice
certain moves (i.e. kicking techniques, self-defense techniques and <span class="writegood-weasels">various</span>
strikes). In addition, kata <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is used</span> to improve a student&#8217;s physical
conditioning, muscle memory, focus/concentration, balance, etc.

{ Note the use of <span class="flyspell-duplicate">kata</span> in coding and software engineering!! }

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Benefits of Kata &#8211; According to kata proponents</span>



+ Solo practice. The ability to practice martial arts techniques without a partner.
+ Ability to practice dangerous techniques without injuring a partner (i.e. practicing to break an elbow joint).
+ Teaches students how to use a variety of techniques (i.e. kicks, strikes and blocks) in different combinations.
+ Reinforces the knowledge of basic techniques and stances via repetition.
+ Muscle memory of different self-defense techniques due to repetition.
+ Concentration.
+ Balance training.
+ Improved fitness &amp; conditioning.
+ Bunkai (kata training with a partner) reinforces the lessons learned in solo kata and shows how kata techniques <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are applied</span> against a &#8220;real&#8221; opponent.
+ Safe practice of weapon-based training (as you are striking an imaginary opponent).
+ Slow kata can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be used</span> a form of &#8220;moving meditation&#8221; or &#8220;dynamic mediation&#8221;.
+ According to USA Taekwondo, benefits include &#8220;You don&#8217;t get kicked in the
  face. You don&#8217;t have to make weight. People are nice to each other. Families
  can take part. Older people can compete&#8221;.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Perceived Negatives of Kata &#8211; According to kata opponents</span>

+ Too stilted &amp; scripted.
+ Imaginary opponents &#8220;don&#8217;t hit back&#8221; (paraphrasing a famous Bruce Lee saying).
+ Too slow. Live opponents move much faster than the actions in <span class="flyspell-duplicate">kata</span>.
+ Teaches <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> questionable or &#8220;antique&#8221; techniques.
+ <span class="writegood-weasels">Many</span> instructors do not teach the self-defense aspects of kata. Therefore, kata can <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be perceived</span> as a martial arts &#8220;dance&#8221; needed just to pass a belt test.
+ Difficult to practice grappling techniques with <span class="flyspell-duplicate">kata</span>.
+ Can be boring for beginners.
+ <span class="writegood-weasels">Some</span> styles require students to learn multiple katas. This can be difficult to
  remember, especially as you progress in your martial arts training and you
  must remember all of the past kata that you <span class="writegood-passive-voice">were taught</span>.
  - <span class="flyspell-incorrect">Lol</span> this is like going to school; e.g., higher maths require low-level
    maths!



<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Is Kata Useful or Useless?</span>

<span class="writegood-weasels">Some</span> martial arts value and use kata &amp; forms extensively (i.e. Shotokan Karate &amp; Taekwondo). Other martial arts find <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> little value in kata (i.e. Boxing and BJJ).

<span class="writegood-weasels">Many</span> martial artists think kata is useful because it teaches things such as memorization, balance, basic techniques, visualization, etc. Moreover, they think it is especially useful for younger color belts and/or when used as bunkai (practicing kata attacks and defenses with a partner). Others are in the middle. They think sparring with a partner is much more useful. However, they see solo kata as useful if you have to train alone (i.e. outside the dojo). Similar to using a kicking dummy, solo kata <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is seen</span> as a way of practicing techniques without a live partner. In contrast, there are <span class="writegood-weasels">many</span> martial artists who feel that kata is a waste of time. They believe it is impractical because it does not teach students how to deal with a live and unpredictable opponent. For more information, you should visit the wiki section on the pros &amp; cons of <span class="flyspell-duplicate">kata</span>.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* responses</span>

i used to enjoy kata as a
workout.

i &#8220;rediscovered&#8221; <span class="flyspell-duplicate">kata</span>
after retiring from pro fighting and saw the value of having a foundation for
your fighting system.

<span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> solid paterns to practice specific technique as well
as the all round health benefits of doing <span class="flyspell-duplicate">kata</span>.

it is also good to look into the
practical application(s) of the movements and techniques.

it also gives the
<span class="flyspell-incorrect">practisioner</span> a syllabus to work to when not at the dojo&#8230;or on holiday etc.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another way to look at kata is to consider the following supposed you were in
the far East in the 1800&#8217;s and you came upon a martial art master who was
willing to teach you techniques from his style. You spent <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> time with him and
learned <span class="writegood-weasels">many</span> techniques. How would you remember what he has taught <span class="writegood-duplicates">you </span><span class="writegood-duplicates"><span class="flyspell-duplicate">you</span></span>
ask. He says to you within the katas I have taught you there are all the
techniques you have learned from me.

There are techniques within katas that are <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> useful. If we look at basic blocks such as a high defend open hand. We know that it is useful. Basic front kicks, side kicks and round house are useful as well. These type of moves <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are incorporated</span> into our katas, or at least <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> them.



Every move you have learned has within it both defensive and offensive
techniques.
So keeping this in mind take a kata that you have learned and see how <span class="writegood-weasels">many</span> self <span class="flyspell-incorrect">defense</span> applications you can find. You will <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be amazed</span>,

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* healthy workout, interpretation of moves: Don't practice something if you cant use it!</span>

I help out with training children in my local dojo, and the way I teach new starts kata is using bunkai. Kata can be boring, but add <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> imaginary ninjas to it and the kids start wanting to learn (then you have that one kid who wants to fight frogs). In my opinion as we inevitably get older, the constant repetitive motions of kata can become a way of warding off senile dementia/alzheimers. Plus if you go perform every kata you know (for me it&#8217;s a miniscule 12) sequentially, given it &#8216;speed and power&#8217;, my instructor likes to make us do this, it can help with weight loss (or gain if you decide to stuff your face after a hard lesson).

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* ingenious</span>

kata are an ingenious way of learning techniques. The <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> essence of a fighting
method has been over centuries (in <span class="writegood-weasels">some</span> cases) distilled into a set pattern of
techniques that if learned correctly will become ingrained in both mind and
muscle memory. I think the key to understanding kata lies in actually focusing
and correct visualization. If you are just going through the motions because
your Sensei has told you to while thinking to yourself &#8216;I can&#8217;t wait to get
through this and spar&#8217; then you are missing the point and also missing an
essential element of the art you <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are supposed</span> to be learning.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* useful for what?</span>

When asking if kata is useful, you must ask useful for what. Kata it is useful for exercise, developing balance, and practicing certain techniques. This is my experience from doing Taekwondo forms for three plus years. Kata is useless for fighting. In Taekwondo sparring I never used anything from forms. My kicks, defenses, counters, and footwork came from constant drilling done in fighting stance, not a kata stance. As a kickboxer as well I think something like shadow boxing is much better, because you can practice all the things I did in forms, but in a realistic fighting stance. <span class="bold">Though today </span><span class="bold"><span class="writegood-weasels">many</span></span><span class="bold"> people take martial arts for </span><span class="bold"><span class="writegood-weasels">various</span></span><span class="bold"> reasons, and have no intention on ever fighting in competition.</span>

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* shadow boxing</span>

Shadow boxing is exactly like a kata. It keeps you sharp and alert at all times. Please !!! Do not underestimate the use of a kata or any imaginary fighting practices , they all work. I&#8217;m still an active boxer and shadow boxing is the most important tool for me today.

<span class="org-hide">*</span><span class="org-level-2">* Kata functions</span>


- Kata teach the martial artist to focus her or his techniques on specific striking and blocking points with special emphasis on follow-up techniques.
- Kata practise strengthens muscles and sinews while increasing fitness and improving flexibility.
- Spatial awareness <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is improved</span> by visualizing imaginary attacks from a number of directions enabling the practitioner to handle more than one attacker at a time.
- Footwork and agility <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are prompted</span> by warding off "attacks" and delivering counterattacks from all angles.
- Balance <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is improved</span> by maintaining one's centre-of-gravity while changing into different stances.
- Correct breathing <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is learned</span> and controlled by the constant stopping and starting, fast and slow movements of the kata performed.
- Kata act as an encyclopedia of kumite scenarios (attacks and defences) which can then <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be practised</span> with a partner. These kata applications <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are known</span> as bunkai and can include tenchin (body evasion movements), punching, striking, kicking and qin-na (grappling, seizing and throwing).
- Kata has <span class="writegood-passive-voice">been called</span> "meditation in motion" and in the endless striving for perfection epitomizes the concept of a martial art. When a kata <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is performed</span> well all the above points should be apparent in the execution of the form. Conversely, a kata can <span class="writegood-weasels">often</span> look pretty but lack all understanding. Kata is therefore the cornerstone to becoming a good martial artist.

making an &#8220;I&#8221;-shape in movement: The student starts at the bottom-middle of the

position. Each formation reinforces basic principles, such as a certain block
and stance.

The <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Fukyu</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Kata</span> <span class="writegood-passive-voice">were made</span> to popularise Karate and make it accessible.

   - This is a long frontal stance where the weight is <span class="writegood-weasels">mostly</span> on the front leg.
   - It has exactly the same height as <span class="flyspell-duplicate">shiko</span>-<span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span> (below), but the rear leg is
     <span class="writegood-weasels">completely</span> straight at the knee and extended back.
   - The front foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is placed</span> frontal (toes facing forward), the rear foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is
     turned</span> out 30 degrees, but never 90 degrees as seems natural to new practitioners
     because this precludes any forward motion.
   - The heel of the rear foot rests on the ground.

   <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Zenkutsu</span> <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is performed</span> as follows:
   1. From the natural stance, step forward so that the distance between the back foot and the front foot is roughly about one and a half to two shoulder width
   2. The feet are one shoulder width apart
   3. The front foot points forward and the back foot points diagonally at about 30 degree angle
   4. The front knee <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is bent</span>, turned slightly inward, and should be forward enough that you are not able to see the toes
   5. The back leg is naturally straight but not locked
   6. Most of the body weight <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is placed</span> on the front leg
   7. The heel of the back leg should <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be placed</span> firmly on the ground.

   - This is a back stance derived from the zenkutsu dachi stance.
   - Start with zenkutsu dachi, move your back leg across so that the front leg
     and the back leg are on the same line.

   <span class="org-drawer">:More:</span>
   K&#333;kutsu-dachi (&#24460;&#23624;&#31435;, back long stance) This is a mirror image of
    zenkutsu-dachi, where the rear leg <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is bent</span> strongly at the knee and the
    front leg is either straight or slightly bent, depending on the style. The
    rear foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is turned</span> 90 degrees to the side. The body <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is turned</span> 90 degrees or
    more away, except for the head which looks to the front. Kokutsu-dachi is a
    great defensive stance because of the amount of energy stored in the rear
    leg, ready for a counter-attack.

   This is the most difficult stance to master and <span class="writegood-weasels">probably</span> the most important
   stance in Goju <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Ryu</span>.  It <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is performed</span> as follows:
   1. Begin with heiko dachi, step one foot forward
   2. The heel of the front foot should be on the same line as the toes of the back foot
   3. The toes of both feet should turn inward slightly
   4. The front foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is turned</span> inward at about 20&#176; angle
   5. Tense your tandien, buttocks and thigh muscles and then pull the hips upwards
   6. The knees should bend and turn inward
   7. The feet should <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be placed</span> firmly on the ground with the toes gripping the ground
   8. The center of gravity should be at the midpoint between the two feet
   9. Keep your back straight and your chin tucked in.

   <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Sanchin</span> kata, considered the core and most difficult kata in Goju Ryu <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is done</span> entirely in the sanchin dachi stance.

    - This stance is close to the natural way people stand.
    - The feet are shoulder width apart, the toes point out at about 45&#176;, the

    To assume neko ashi <span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span>:
    1. Start with musubi dachi (formal attention stance) and step forward for a distance of about one foot
    2. Lower the hips deeply and transfer most of the body weight to the back leg
    3. The front leg <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is bent</span> and the heel of the front leg <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is raised</span> slightly with only the toes and the ball of the front foot touches the ground
    4. The back foot points outward at about 30 to 45 degree angle
    5. About 90% of the body weight <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is placed</span> on the back foot.

    Note:
    - All weight rests on the back leg, which <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is bent</span> at the knee.
    - The rear foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is turned</span> at about 20-30 degrees out and the knee sits at

    - Only the toes of the front foot rest on the ground, positioned in front of
      the back heel.
    - There is no weight on the front foot, and there is no bent in the ankle
      joint - front knee, front shin, and the rise of the foot (but not the
      toes) form a single line.

    <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Bensoku</span>-<span class="flyspell-duplicate">d</span><span class="flyspell-incorrect"><span class="flyspell-duplicate">achi</span></span>, <span class="italic">Cross-legged stance</span> - Drop the left down, toes pointing to the right. Right steps
    towards the back right corner of the room. Finally, left leg slides behind
    the right leg, ending with the heel up and the toes planted and facing the
    right leg.

    To assume bensoku <span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span>:
    1. Cross one leg behind the other
    2. Bend both knees
    3. The front foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is placed</span> firmly on the ground but only the ball of the back foot touches the ground
    4. The knee of the back foot <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is nested</span> against the back of the front knee.

    <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Bensoku</span> dachi is a transitional stance that <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is used</span> when one needs to change
    direction. It appears in kata like Seiyunchin and <span class="flyspell-incorrect">Sepai</span>.

19. <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Zenkustu</span> with the right leg towards the back left of the room; the left leg

20. <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Neko</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Ashi</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Dachi</span> - Bring the right leg back into a cat stance

21. Drop the right down and do a <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Bensoku</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Dachi</span>

22. <a href="image:https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-shiko-dachi-Copy.jpg|50|50">image:https://www.karatephilosophy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Goju-ryu-stance-shiko-dachi-Copy.jpg|50|50</a>

    <span class="flyspell-incorrect">Shiko</span>-<span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span>, <span class="italic">Square Stance, Horse Stance, Straddle Leg Stance</span>

    The left leg moves towards the back of the room, ending in a <span class="flyspell-duplicate">shiko</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span>;
    right leg remains where it is.

    The toes face out at about 45 degrees. Knees point outward, and stance is <span class="writegood-weasels">often</span> low.

    To assume shiko <span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span>, start with hachiji dachi stance, turn the heels to
    point the toes outward at about 45 degrees and lower the hips.

    In this stance:
    + The feet are about two shoulder width apart
    + The big toes point outward diagonally at about 45 degrees
    + The knees <span class="writegood-passive-voice">are turned</span> outward
    + The back is straight
    + The hips are lower than in kiba dachi and the thighs are almost parallel to the ground
    + The body weight is evenly distributed between the two legs
    + The soles of the feet are firmly in contact with the ground.

    <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Shiko</span> dachi is a great stance for developing lower body strength and stability.

23. Look rightwards towards the center of the room, then do a <span class="flyspell-duplicate">shiko</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">dachi</span>
    ---ending with body facing the right side of the room; i.e., right leg is in
    the back.

24. Bring the back leg, the right leg, up to the front leg into a <span class="flyspell-incorrect">Musubu</span> <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Dachi</span>.

It is the fundamental <span class="flyspell-incorrect">kata</span> of GoJu Ryu. Sanchin develops discipline, determination, focus, perseverance and other mental attributes.

Sanchin is <span class="writegood-weasels">probably</span> the most misunderstood Kata in all of Karate. In contrast, it is <span class="writegood-weasels">probably</span> the single most valuable training exercise in Goju Ryu. Sanchin has such aspects as deep, diaphragmatic breathing found in <span class="writegood-weasels">many</span> internal arts as well as external attributes like mechanical alignment and muscular strength.
<span class="org-level-1">* </span><span class="org-special-keyword">COMMENT</span><span class="org-level-1"> </span><span class="org-level-1"><span class="flyspell-duplicate">Eiichi</span></span><span class="org-level-1"> Miyazato and the Jundokan</span>

Eiichi Miyazato was a senior student of <span class="flyspell-duplicate">Chojun</span> Miyagi and founder of the Jundokan branch of Okinawan Goju-Ryu. Miyazato <span class="writegood-passive-voice">was born</span> in 1922 in Naha. In 1938, at the age of 15 he would meet Chojun Miyagi and begin studying Goju-Ryu. In addition to his Goju-Ryu training Miyazato was also a Judo practitioner. Miyazato would <span class="writegood-weasels">often</span> assist Miyagi in instructing at the police academy as well as in the Garden Dojo.

Following Chojun Miyagi's death, Miyazato succeeded him as the police instructor as well as the instructor at the garden dojo. Soon Goju-Ryu was becoming <span class="writegood-weasels">very</span> popular and the garden dojo was no longer sufficient. In 1957 the Jundokan dojo would finally <span class="writegood-passive-voice">be built</span>. Most of the hojo undo equipment used by the Jundokan was the same equipment that <span class="writegood-passive-voice">was used</span> in Miyagi's garden dojo. Miyazato had inherited the equipment from Miyagi.

For a long time Miyazato was the all Japan-Police Judo champion as well as the Okinawan Judo champion. He served as the vice-president and later president of the Okinawan Judo Federation. Miyazato took his responsibilities seriously, and <span class="writegood-passive-voice">was determined</span> to pass on Miyagi's legacy. Jundokan <span class="writegood-weasels">literally</span> means "House of Father's Way" or "House for Following in the Father's Footsteps".

Miyazato taught <span class="writegood-weasels">many</span> students, both from Okinawa and from around the world. A <span class="writegood-weasels">few</span> of the more famous ones include Teruo Chinen, Morio Higaonna, Taira Masaji, Yoshio Hichiya and Tetsu Gima. Classes at the Jundokan <span class="writegood-passive-voice">were reported</span> to be <span class="writegood-weasels">fairly</span> informal, with students generally practicing on their own and more senior students assisting the newer ones. Miyazato passed away in 1999. He held the rank of 10th Dan in Goju-Ryu and 7th Dan in Kodokan Judo. Today the Jundokan is one of the largest and most recognized branches of Goju-Ryu. The organisation <span class="writegood-passive-voice">is run</span> by his senior students that are there.
