English relies on /word order/ for meaning; for example, /Jim hit Bob/ is a sentence where the person doing the action is
/Jim/ and we know it has to be /Jim/, and not /Bob/, since /Jim/ is the word /before/ the action /hit/. However, in Arabic words can
be ordered in almost any way you like! Then how do we identifiy who does an action? We use case markings: We add small
symbols to the end of words to indiciate the role they play in a sentence.

One day, my wife and I were looking at the word خبز, and we each read
it differently: I read it as خَبَزَ “he baked”, but she read it as خُبْز
“bread”. Without a context, we each guessed different short vowels!

Here's another one!

What does حملت mean? Since ح−م−ل means “carrying”, and ـت is the past tense suffix, we have /at least/ the following meanings:
| حَمَلْتُ | I carried               |
| حَمَلْتَ | You (masculine) carried |
| حَمَلْتِ | You (feminine) carried  |
| حَمَلَتْ | She carried             |
| حُمَِلتْ | She was carried         |

Without the short symbols, the only way to distinuigh the intended
meaning is for the word to be contextually located within a sentence
---and even then, this would require experience.

Likewise, what does نصرت فاطمة mean? Does it mean “Fatimah helped (someone)”? Or does it mean “Fatimah was helped (by
someone)”?


One English sentence can be written a number of ways in Arabic:

| Fatima helped Zaynab |
|----------------------|
| نصرت فاطمةُ  زينبَ         |
| نصرت زينبَ فاطمةُ          |
| فاطمةُ نصرت زینبَ          |
The way the listener knows what’s the subject and what’s the object is quite literally carried around with the nouns themselves. The endings make all the difference.

The second instance above might seem weird at first, since the object comes before the subject, but it is more common
when the object is an attached pronoun:
| نصرتْها فطمةُ | Fatima helped her. |
This is a common example of verb-object-subject!



1. Just as people dress according to roles or occassions (such as a
   suit at work and pajamas in bed), so too Arabic words have
   different case endings, التشكيلُ, to show their roles within a
   sentence.

   Roles are indicated by the vowel sign on the final letter of a word.
   |----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | Role                             | Ending Vowel | Case (Grammatical Name) |
   |----------------------------------+--------------+-------------------------|
   | Subject; the one doing an action | ـُــ            | مارفوع / Nominative      |
   | Object; the one being acted upon | ـَــ            | منصوب / Accusative     |
   | Owner of a thing                 | ـِــ            | مجرور / Genetive         |


2. *Nunation*: When the word is indefinite, one “doubles” the symbols,
   which causes an extra /-n/ sound to each vowel: u ـُـ, a ـَـ, i ـِـ
   are replaced by un ـٌـ, an ـًـ, in ـٍـ.
